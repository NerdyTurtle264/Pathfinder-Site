      <p style="text-indent: 20px">So the first thing that needs to be done when it comes to making characters is to talk to your GM about any limitations
        to be aware of. They may have certain classes, races, or backgrounds that just will not work with their campaign
        they are planning as well as roles that need filled for the party. There is nothing worse than rolling up to a game
        with a wizard and finding out that it is a no magic campaign. Your GM may even have suggestions on something that
        will allow you to play a bigger part of their story, and everyone wants more story right?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">Once that is done you have to decide on what type they will be. Will they be the type that runs up to enemies and attacks
        it directly, do they try to flank and aim for vital points, do they use magic to damage or hinder enemies, or do
        they try to aid their allies so they can fight better than they would normally?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">All this can usually be boiled down to the four classic archtypes. Fighter, Thief, Mage, and Healer. In pathfinder
        there are 45 different classes to choose from. Each of which falls into at least one of these 4 archtypes. I am not
        going to get into all the classes in order to preserve my sanity. If you are new to playing I would suggest looking
        at the following classes Fighter, Rogue, Sorcerer, and Oracle as they are the easiest for new comers to keep track
        of. When more experienced that is the time to get into some of the more complicated classes.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">Once you have decided on what class you are going to play the next step is to figure out a race. Once again there are
        35 different races so I am not delving into all of that. The core ones are the ones most are familiar with so if
        you are new to playing you will want to look at Human, Elf, Halfling, Gnome, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, and Dwarf. Most
        of these will make sense to those who have seen The Lord of the Rings.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">I am not going to go into every aspect of character making because it has probably already been done better by other
        people. We will now move on to links to things I have found useful and would like to share with you.</p>
