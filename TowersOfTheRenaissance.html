				brothers,
				Silvius, Quirinus, Aelius, and Marius, especially as they grew older and joined the military themselves, coming
				back
				bigger and stronger each time. In full contrast to his loud and frankly obnoxious brothers, Magnus was quiet and

				no
				time for that, choosing mischief and pranks instead. When she approached the proper age, her mother went so far as
				to
				suggest that the family could somehow pay their way out of Serena’s military service. Serena was furious at the
				idea
				and insisted that she go. The two argued about whether she should go up until the moment that Serena left home for

			<h1>Prologue</h1>
			<p>
				Patriam suffered a magic plague 500 years ago where all magic was neutralized. The people in the time since have
				been developing
				technological means of accomplishing the same sort of effects however. In a land devoid of magic including healing
				magic
				the people have adapted to this wholeheartedly and even have begun to incorporate technology into their own bodies,
				sometimes
				as a way of replacing limbs lost in battle, sometimes as a symbol of their class. The people of this land are
				scared
				and proud of it. The cause of the magic plague is lessening now though and magic is beginning to have a resurgence.
				Some
				are using it for it's original purposes and some are using it to power technological creations never thought
				possible
				before. The country has a conscription service for the citizens. Everyone has to spend 10 years in the military
				once
				they reach the age of adulthood. After the 10 years people can choose to stay in the service of their country and
				many
				do. You will all be playing members of the Patriam military at the start of their career assigned to a smaller unit
				towards
				the border of the country.

	<div class="w3-row">
		<div class="w3-content w3-padding">
			<h1 class="w3-center">Our Story</h1>
			<h3>Getting to Base First</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">We start everything off as the players are on their way to the military base they will
				be stationed at. It is a small
				base towards the south on the outskirts of a town named Theodin. It is a peaceful part of the country by the border
				with
				Merra. The travel there isn’t too difficult, the only conflict being with native wildlife.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">When they get to the base Major Desma and Captain Ignacio are outside waiting for them.
				They introduce themselves and
				begin showing the group around the grounds. When the tour is over the group is told to feel free to explore the
				base
				and become acquainted with everyone there and the layout. Serena goes to the armory to check it out and meets Jynx
				who
				is startled by the entry and when she goes to turn around she trips with a loaded firearm which goes off
				ricocheting
				around the room and knocks embers from the forge onto the floor.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">When the group is done exploring they are taken to a local cave for a training
				exercise. The are randomly put into sections
				of a cave and have to fight. This goes poorly when Magnus ends up severly injuring Cassius and the exercise is
				halted.</p>

			<h3>Missing Kids</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">A couple days pass and the first mission comes in. There is a town in the nearby area
				that has had a couple kids and an
				old woman dissapear. The group sets out in the morning and gets there as the sun is about to set. Desma goes to
				talk
				to the most recent victims family and the group is tasked with searching for clues. They end up finding a makeshift
				fort
				built in the woods not too far away. There is also a spot next to a tree with cigar butts and tracks from smooth
				soled
				boots. Someone recognizes the type of tobacco in the cigars as a strain grown in Sandora. Someone else finds out
				that
				the town used to have a mine in the area and figures that is probably where the kids were taken.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">When they confront the Sandoran slavers it is revealed that Desma’s arm is on a chain
				and has a launching mechanism that
				when it hits something the hand locked closed. She uses this to grab people from a distance and drag them in to
				attack
				in melee. Magnus ends up picking up an interesting dagger from one of the minions.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Instead of taking the kids back to the base for questioning they take the old woman
				since she would probably be a better
				witness and they didn’t want to take the kids away from their families so soon after getting saved.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">When they get back to the base they find Olek outside waiting. He goes to help the old
				woman down from the cart and as
				he does there is an audible *pop* as his back goes out. He manages to keep a straight face though and is able to
				hand
				her off to someone else to lead into the base. </p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">*While everyone else was away from base on the mission Cassius ended up having to stay
				back due to his injuries in the
				cave. While he is there he goes to head to town and spots Olek on the trail up ahead. He quickly overtakes him and
				begins
				trying to make small talk. Olek does so for a bit but after a while he stops on the trail and says “We have to go
				back.
				My rheumatism is acting up again.” Cassius is confused but unwilling to argue and so the two head back to base. As
				soon
				as they get back to base Olek bars the front door and asks Cassius if he ”saw them!?” They begin locking all the
				doors
				and windows then make their way to the armory where he has the girls work on a way for them to see out. Jynx says
				she
				will make a “peri-glass” and begins fitting mirrors into pipes lying around and then drills a hole in the roof.
				Upon
				looking out a suspicious figure is caught watching the base around a tree. The base begins making preparations for
				an
				assault. As night is about to set a voice is heard yelling for everyone inside to surrender. Olek begins spouting
				off
				something about “The Frozen Inch” and how he would never surrender. The outside group respond as would be expected
				and
				begin knocking down the doors. Olek orders the rest of the base to defend the Western half and he will protect the
				Eastern.
				To Cassius’s surprise he actually does. He stands in the middle of the hallway with his cane and his fighting style
				is
				rather unorthodox as he waits for his opponents to attack and counter attacks using their power against them.*</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The next day the group heads into town to help Olek do his shopping for the base. When
				he gets there he is immediately
				swarmed with kids who tease him about hurting his back in between trying to haggle him to pay them for carrying the
				stuff
				he buys or pushing his wheelchair. Olek boasts saying that he was injured defeating 50 men. The kids scoff and
				Calida
				begins telling an even more outlandish tale about how it happened than what Olek told them.</p>

			<h3>Olek’s Retirement</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">As the days pass Olek doesn’t end up feeling much better. He decides that this will be
				it. He must finally retire. Everyone
				begins trying to find something to give him for his retirement. Calida makes him a stained glass ornament of the
				base
				symbol. Cassius make a more reinforced cane for him so he can smack people with it better. Honerva helps Fulvia
				make
				a seat cushion. Magnus goes to bring the old woman who he was interested in for his party. Serena gets a book for
				the
				local children to sign for him. Ignacio gets him a book for him to write his tales in. Desma collects news
				clippings
				of his exploits “to remember what actually happened”. Jynx and Hyde make him a special wheelchair that can climb
				stairs
				(and has rocket boost courtesy of Jynx). Cadoc prepares the food for the festivities (a wonderful grilled steak
				with
				vegetables and for desert a delicious carrot cake.) The children put together a play of one of Olek’s battles. The
				play
				almost ends in a fight though as the children begin arguing about what happened since Olek has told so many
				different
				versions. Just as it is about to escalate Olek stands up and begins clapping “Wonderful! That’s exactly how I
				remember
				it!” The parents then swoop in and quell the children and start prepping them to go home. One of the tables at the
				party
				consists of some of Olek’s old comrades. Zaren his friend he would stand shoulder to shoulder with on the front
				lines
				is almost as stooped as Olek is. Fieri an elven alchemist hasn’t changed much. And Disuos a human who ended up
				being
				an ambassador to Tian Xia. The final member of their party, Quill, nobody seems to know the whereabouts of since he
				retired
				and Fieri seemed glad he hadn’t shown up.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The party is interrupted though when the table in front of Desma begins to warp as a
				mouth appears and says “Desma Fide,
				I have a message for you” as it spits a scroll in her direction. As she reads the scroll her face contorts in anger
				and
				she crumples the note in her fist and slams it on the table before storming out of the tavern. Ignacio quickly
				reads
				the letter before heading out to follow her. When the party is over the group heads back to base and as it comes
				into
				view they see the destruction that Desma left in her wake through the training grounds. The dummies have all been
				smashed
				and half of one is even spotted on the roof of the base.</p>

			<h3>Under New Management</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">It is discovered that Olek’s replacement has already been decided. A man by the name of
				Stain. He was the man who poorly
				led the battle that Desma ended up breaking rank in to save her unit. Desma and Ignacio are furious that he has
				been
				stationed above them again thinking that he is coming out of revenge for her insubordination. The matter is made
				worse
				by the fact that Desma is almost constantly getting letters sent to her by the man as he makes his way to the base.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The day that he is to arrive the caravan is spotted in the distance and the seal of the
				honor guard is on the side of
				the carts. One of the carts begins having the horses sprinting and the rest follow suit but it is too late the
				first
				cart has too much of a lead and easily gets there before the rest. A man hops down from the front of the cart and
				the
				soldier that was next to him tries to protest saying that there is a procedure for this. The man waves him away and
				says
				that it is their fault that it took so long for him to get here in the first place. It is important to note that
				traveling
				from the capitol to the base takes a week usually and they made it in 4 days. The man tells them all to get out of
				here
				so he can start to work. The honor guard complies and begins heading down the path away from the base. The man then
				turns
				to the group and introduces himself as Brigadier General Stain. Once he is done meeting the members of the base
				Desma
				and Ignacio lead him on the tour of the base. When they are spotted walking around it is easily noted that Stain
				has
				the look of someone who has gotten stuck walking behind a particularly slow group on a narrow sidewalk.</p>

			<h3>Giants In A Giant Cave And One Particularly Giant Giant</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">That night a report comes in about Giants raiding caravans in the area. Stain decides
				that this would be a great opportunity
				to see everyone in action so he take the whole group along. Someone brings up that the base would be left
				defenseless
				so Stain gets the bright idea to send a message to the honor guards to turn back and come defend the base… poor
				honor
				guards. On the road to the giant cave Jynx is sitting on top of a small cart with a tarp on it pulled behind one of
				the
				horses. When the giant cave is spotted Jynx begins setting up “Pow-Pow Jr” as Cassius is sent to get the giants
				attention
				and bring them within range. As soon as Cassius gets to safety Jynx begins her barrage leaving all of the ones that
				left
				the cave dead. It leaves the group in awe of the power and the joy that Jynx seems to have unleashing it. The group
				makes
				their way into the cave killing several more giants. When they get to the last section there are several giants all
				grouped
				up together and one of them is at least 5 feet taller than the rest. He is probably the leader. Stain decides that
				he
				will take that one on personally racing past the others. The two are a close match but Stain comes out the winner
				after
				several rounds quite injured. He then proceeds to pick up Magnus and toss him at one of the remaining giants. With
				the
				last of the giants slain Magnus goes over to the largest of them and pulls a black tower shield off of it that it
				had
				been using as a buckler. The shield has dwarven ruins carved into it. After fighting the giant one on one Stain is
				rather
				injured but turns down healing, instead he opens his safe and pulls out a vial of black liquid and drinks it. His
				wounds
				close up a bit afterwards and that night he is seen reading from a massive tome but he claims that he is just
				writing
				in his jounal.</p>

			<h3>Home Invasion</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain refuses to go to a military meeting and instead sends Desma and Ignacio. While
				they are gone the group is training
				and decides to invite Stain to join them but they can’t find him. Since he is away it is decided that they should
				do
				some snooping. Cassius decides to leave a potion of invisibility lying around for someone else to use. Serena
				decides
				that she will do the snooping and have Honerva be lookout. Serena unlocks the office door and begins going through
				drawers
				and finds that he dumped all of his medals into one of the drawers and the rest of them are empty. Stain doesn’t
				have
				much in terms of personal items so there isn’t much to find in his office. She decides to go into the bedroom
				portion
				and in the chest at the foot of the bed finds Stains safe. Looking it over there isn’t a keyhole, there also isn’t
				a
				mechanism to open it except for the hand groves that are worn into the door where he apparently pries it open every
				time.
				She decides to put it back and continue searching and eventually take another look out in the office. While she is
				there
				though the front door of the base is heard smashing. In less than two seconds his is in front of Honerva grabbing
				her
				by the front of the shirt and dragging her into his office past the invisible Selena and aggressively telling her
				“Face
				to the floor now.” She complies and Selena feeling bad goes in to try to calm the situation. Stain notices that
				there
				was no sound from the door to the office just the knocking on the bedroom door. He opens the door and tells her the
				same
				thing as Honerva. Eventually the rest of the players except for Magnus make their way to the floor of the bedroom
				and
				are questioned one by one. To everyone’s surprise Stain doesn’t punish them for what they did and even when Desma
				gets
				back makes no mention of it.</p>

			<h3>Merran Madness Comes To Patriam</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The group is then contacted by a messenger about the sound of explosions from outside
				his hometown. The group heads out
				immediately to try to figure out what is going on. Due to the significance of the situation the group ends up
				taking
				a shortcut through a swamp and getting attacked by a giant alligator. When they finally get to the area in question
				the
				ground is littered with craters and the glow of a campfire can be seen through the trees up ahead. Serena scouts
				ahead
				to see what is going on. She finds two male half-orcs and two human females sitting around the fire. One of the
				half-orcs
				looks in her direction and she is compelled to walk up to the group. He then says ”We have plenty to eat if you are
				hungry.”
				Serena yelled and the rest of the group comes running to help. Stain gets there first and said “You are bad at
				this”
				while picking her up and whispering “check out the rest of the area” before tossing her away from the camp. As
				Stain
				and the leader of this group talk the group begins talking to the others from the campfire. Turns out they are
				merchants
				from Merra coming up to sell magical items. Stain pulls out some of his pay checks and begins buying some of the
				magical
				items. Eventually it is decided to continue searching the area for clues and while passing by one of the craters
				Cassius
				notices that the dirt in the bottom gives off a very minor purple sheen, so he begins taking samples and performing
				experiments.
				When he adds acid to the sample in a glass tube it fizzles and then melts its way through the glass. When sparked
				it
				causes an explosion. Stain then orders to stop messing with it and get back to work. After circling the area
				looking
				for prints and not finding any they decide to try to talk with the merchants again but when they get to the
				campfire
				the people are gone.</p>

			<h3>Turtle Tumult</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The start of the day Stain says that he will be taking over training for the base.
				Everyone will have to participate.
				For the next 4 days everyone will be spending 8 hours a day training. Most have strength and endurance training but
				others
				have breathing exercises to steady their aim. On the fifth day they are told to “relax but be ready”. Stain can be
				spotted
				on top of the stables after breakfast keeping lookout. Eventually the sound of loud singing and marching can be
				heard
				down the path. As the group gathers they can see an odd sight. There is a dwarf riding on top of a turtle phalanx
				formation,
				singing and drinking. When they come within range Stain shouts to the group “This will be a competition between the
				lowest
				ranked of the base and the trainees of the dwarf brigade. If they make it to the base we lose. You have to flip
				them.”
				The group is rather unsure of how to proceed at first. Trying to blast it with fireballs, tie them up with rope,
				shooting
				at the shields. Eventually Honerva gets up to it and forces a fireball through a small gap and the pressure pops it
				up
				off the ground. Magnus and Serena knock it to fall on one side more than the other and Honerva pushes it to fall
				the
				rest of the way over winning the training competition. </p>

			<h3>Drunk and Disorderly</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">As the dwarven formation flips the number of them under there hits them along with the
				smell. These dwarves must have
				been marching days straight from the South to get here. As they unlock their shields and stand up Rein sidles up to
				Stain
				and whispers something to him "Who are you going by this time?" After everyone is introduced the dwarves march off
				to
				the river to wash. When they get back they set up camp in the woods not far from the base using their shields as
				tents
				for themselves. Stain tells Rein that there is someone in town that would love to meet him. As the two are setting
				off
				to town most of the rest of the base goes along with. They are going to see Olek but as they get close Stain
				disappears
				from the group. On the way back to the base they go to the tavern to purchase ale for the dwarves and wine for
				everyone
				else. Desma interjects that the wine won't be necessary since there is plenty in the base. When they get back to
				the
				base she goes to Ignacio and tells him to bring out about 10 bottles. He then goes to his locker and pulls out 10
				fancy
				wooden boxes with "Ingenium Winery" carved into the side and begins opening them and throwing away the containers</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">During the meal Rein loudly says to Stain "I heard what you did to the boy. Wasn't
				taking his arm off a bit excessive?"
				Stain immediately shushes him and tells him to shut up about that. After that Desma and Ignacio are clearly
				uncomfortable.
				Not that the group would notice. They were drinking on the other side of the room and not doing well on their Fort
				saves.
				Calida ends up oversharing about how she doesn't understand a lot of things on the surface, but she feels more at
				home
				here than she ever did in the Underdark. It is then decided that everyone should share a secret. Serena reveals
				that
				she thinks Stain is hot (he overhears and gives a flirty wink back). Honerva reveals that is blind and that she
				likes
				Fulvia. Magnus reveals that he has four brothers Jynx stands up and says "The stalactite wasn't an accident. I did
				it
				on purpose for Mother." Previously it was told that Jynx got her name because during an experiment in the Underdark
				she
				supposedly accidentally knocked down a massive stalactite and almost crushed an opposing Noble house. If anyone in
				the
				drow city found out about this, it would mean the destruction of the Tenebrae house. The dwarf brigade not
				understanding
				the impact of such a revelation make a crack "darn mushroom elves can't handle their wine." Calida flips out at
				this
				and shouts at them "Rock munching Ibliths!" None of them know what that means though, so they just shrug and Calida
				is
				drunk enough that someone quickly distracts her.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">As things wind down Cassius makes sure to stay in the dining hall to try to listen in
				on what is going on with Stain and
				Desma. When Stain walks into her office he creeps over and listens through the door. Desma asks "What is going on?
				Who
				was he talking about out there?"</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain meekly responds "It doesn't matter. He deserved it and you don't have to worry"</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Desma dripping venom shouts at him "THIS doesn't matter. You try to ruin someone’s
				career, their life, and it doesn't
				matter? Who was it this time?"</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">"Aurelious"</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Desma confused by this "The Lieutenant Colonel? In the interrogation I said it wasn't
				him. I acted on my own."</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">"No. It wasn't that. He was the one that wrote and signed your court martial behind my
				back. I was so asleep back then
				I didn't even pay enough attention to notice."</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">"...So it wasn't you? You really didn't come here for some sort of revenge?"</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">"No. I told you the truth back then why I am here. So will you finally accept my
				offer?"</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">"I still don't understand why you want this but fine. I accept."</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain excitedly says “Wonderful. I would like the announcement to be tomorrow morning.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The next day after breakfast it is announced that Stain is to be treated as a First
				Lieutenant and Desma will be in charge
				except when an outside member of the base is around.</p>

			<h3>Murder Party</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Word comes that the neighboring colony will be joining Patriam.</p>
			<h3>Base Boredom</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius continues his experiments trying to unlock the secrets of the crystals. He asks
				the other members of the base who can cast magic to cast spells with and without the crystals to measure their
				effects on the different schools of magic. When it comes conjuration he has Ignacio cast <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wall-of-stone/">Wall
					of Stone</a> thinking to create a defensive perimeter around the base. As the spell is cast with the crystal
				however, the wall begins to form but begins to morph stopping its growth lengthwise and gaining thickness as well
				as height till it is a massive black cylindrical tower ascending into the sky. The sunlight hitting the tower
				reflects with a purple sheen matching the crystals that were used to summon this monolith.</p>
