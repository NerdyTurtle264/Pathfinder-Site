          <h1>Goram Gods</h1>
          <h3>circa 1321</h3>
          <h5>This is where it all began. Most of us were new to the game, myself included. We played for two years in this campaign
            so it was our longest by far. We started without much clue on how to go about things. We played for a few months
            like that then did a reboot where people could redesign their characters and we moved to a new area. With two
            years of gaming there were tons of adventures that shaped the world and many different NPCs that have carried
            over to other campaigns.</h5>

      <h1 class="w3-center">Their Backstories</h1>
      <p>Rouge: A kitsune from a forest on the West coast of The Wastes. Not much of one for the childbearing culture of her
        kitsune village she set off to see the world. She ends up finding more than she bargained for with finding her soul
        mate and her adopted daughter.</p>
      <p>Lilith: A swordmage with a sordid family ancestry. Her great grandfather is one of the great demons of hell. A balor
        named Eertu. Lilith has a penchant for shiny things. She however isn't good at stealth and as such is frequently
        foiled by her friends in her pursuit of the shiny.</p>
      <p>Castiel: He was a... special paladin. He was devoted to his god but very forgetful. He wouldn't catch certain queues
        and end up losing his powers. Whenever this would happen he would have to do something to prove himself to his god
        in order to gain his favor again.</p>
      <p>Thomas: Raised by a family of carpenters he set off to find glory for himself. Thomas didn't have the best of luck
        in his travels however. He often ended up on the nasty end of a trap and in one adventure was cursed with lycanthropy.</p>
      <p>Bearington: Raised by an eccentric wizard who gifted him with greater intelligence. While growing up he developed a
        fascination the banjo. Eventually his wizard friend disappeared and Bearington set out to try to find him once again.
        He wanted to eventually be knighted so he could be called Sir Bearington.</p>
      <p>Benevolence: The lost daughter of the masterful Dover blacksmiths. She got lost long ago and has been searching for
        them ever since. Ben was a crafty fighter, often resorting to dirty tricks to blink her enemies. Not that she needed
        to with her luck.</p>
      <p>Jen: Started off in a group opposing the party working for one of the anti-heroes of the campaign and when it was revealed
        what he was doing her group joined with the players as a backup group. She was instrumental in the final battle and
        without her everything would have been lost</p>

      <h1 class="w3-center">Our Story</h1>
      <h3>Midnight Mirror</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">It all begins in the small town of Sandpoint. It is a border town between the country of Styrk to the North and "the
        wastes" to the South. Our group is a guild by the name of The Vaguely Helpful Group hereafter referred to as TVHG.
        They get a mission from a lower noblewoman to check on her daughter in the nearby town of Karpad. The daughter married
        the baron of the town and had a child recently. In the past month though the town had stopped all contact with the
        outside world and wouldn't allow anyone past the walls. It was to be a mission to simply make contact with the daughter
        and report back.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">As TVHG gets there the sun is setting and the town is surrounded by walls and bathed in the light of torches and bonfires.
        The guards at the main entrance don't want to let them in to the town but TVHG convinces the guards to let them past
        as they have business with the baron.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">In the town people are terrified. The townspeople are carrying torches everywhere they go and there are bonfires on
        every street corner. Through a bit of investigation they find out that people are going missing and getting sick
        with goiter like protusions that hatch shadow creaturs, killing the host and anyone nearby. The town is made up of
        the usual races: humans, elves, dwarves, etc. but it also has a population of people that are called fetchlings.
        These people have ties to the plane of shadow in their ancestry and as such they are getting blamed for the murders
        that are going on.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">The next day they find a mob in the town center shouting. There is a fetchling family being attacked. The group puts
        an end to it by convincing the mob to disperse. They then foil the cause of people disappearing. Turns out that some
        have turned to a fey creature of light to try to combat the shadows. The creature in question is named Ilquis, he
        has been kidnapping people as sacrifices to bring more of his kind to the plane. He ends up escaping before the group
        can kill him though.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">The group discovers that the manor has an extradimensional prison in the basement. It is a mirror portal to a shadow
        plane. The mirror is cracked and letting shadow essence through which is what is infecting people. They go into the
        prison to try to find a way to stop what is going on. Turns out that the baron had used it to imprison his older
        brothers so he would get the throne upon the death of his father. While they were making their way through the prison
        they found a group of Shadow Hounds and had to fight them. After killing them it was discovered that a pup was tucked
        in part of the room. With its parents dead it wouldn’t survive. The group swaddled it up and took it with them. One
        of the brothers ended up fathering a child with a Shae woman before he died. They end up finding the heart of the
        prison. A shadowy tree called a Tendriculos. Using a shard from the broken portal they are able to slay the creature.
        As it dies the dimension begins to collapse. Because the fabric of this dimension is deteriorating the rooms have
        strange random effects. Floors turning to quicksand, no gravity, complete impenetrable darkness, and the like.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">When they make it out one of the prisoners, Nicasor tries to kill the baron but is convinced to let due process take
        place and the son of the brother could take over the town when he became old enough. They still have the Shadow Pup
        too, they raise it and name it Madeline. </p>

      <h3>The Suntingtons</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">Rodney started off as Benevolence and switched to another character named Inva Suntington III (Eventually she switched
        back) at the start was playing a fetchling ninja character named Inva Suntington III. Inva's namesake, her grandmother,
        was a famous elven wizard adventurer hundreds of years ago. Inva got a letter from her senile grandfather saying
        that her grandmother had died. As TVHG was packing to head to the funeral they heard townspeople on the street screaming.
        Running out they see a skeletal dragon with a rider atop it in the town square. The rest of the group readies to
        battle the menace but Inva recognizes it as the family transport "Krunk" and the rider on top as the family's chauffer
        "Snarl" and tells the group as much to their confusion. After a bit more explaining everyone climbs on Krunk for
        the journey to the Suntington Manor.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">Upon arriving they begin to realize the grandeur of their situation. The manor is massive with extensions in all directions.
        The group is welcomed in by Valkar the butler. In the parlor they meet Inva's family: Her cousins Olivia and Percival
        (half-elves) and then her grandfather Theodore who is a... Lich?! In his 500 years of lich-dom his brain has deteriorated
        and he is now senile. During the reading of the will Inva ends up inheriting the mansion (Theodore gets the guest
        house) as well as a Headband to increase intelligence. Percival dislikes this since he didn't get anything and during
        the night he sneaks into the study where a large glass orb is that controls the house and uses it to try to teleport
        the house away from Inva. The teleportation goes poorly of course and the house gets torn apart. The missing wings
        of the mansion are spread around in The Wastes. TVHG is faced with an interesting problem though. In its incomplete
        state the mansion is unable to further teleport. Theodore in his old man ramblings says something about "get the
        house to fly like the Old City. Oh what was its name...(walks over to a shelf and picks up a compass, reading it
        says) Ulduvai". The compass he picked up is a relic from a crashed trade city. The compass is supposed to always
        point towards the city. Maybe they could salvage parts of the city to make the mansion fly to the missing parts.</p>

      <h3>Crucible of Chaos</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">Exploring the new area around the mansion they discover they are now in the middle of a desert. To the west is a pirate
        city called Kaer Maga built at the mouth of a river. While exploring they get in some trouble when Thomas catches
        a pickpocket trying to rob him. He takes the would be thief to the "guard" who are so corrupt that they refuse to
        take action since the pickpocket paid protection money to Captain Kurth, one of the High Captains of the city. Out
        of character, upon finding out that the guards won't do anything about the pickpocket, Mike says that he strips the
        pickpocket and steals his clothes. Mind you they never left the guard station. He is doing this in front of the guards
        (which are corrupt yes, but they have been paid off by the high captain, not by Mike's character Thomas). He is then
        chased off by the guards and the group has to flee, following the compass to the North.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">They travel for many days reaching a mountain range. The compass leads them through a mountain pass to a valley between
        the mountains. They see the city at the end of the valley. Great golden walls surround it. As they get to the gates
        there are demons guarding it who attack them as they approach. The fight doesn't isn't going well and as the group
        is almost beaten they hear voices behind them. Turning around they see another adventuring party. The party is made
        up of two fetchlings, a human, an Aasimar, and a monkey with an Allosaurus companion. One of the fetchlings taps
        the human fighter on the back launching him dozens of feet, landing next to one of the demons where he smashes its
        head in. Our party, thankful for the help of this new group, decides to camp outside the gate for the night and invites
        the new group to join them. During the night they discover that the group is named the Knight Lights and the fetchling
        that performed the magic earlier is named Jarlaxle. Jarlaxle hired the Knight Lights to venture with him to discover
        the lost city of Ulduvai. Inva of course finds Jarlaxle attractive so she sneaks into his tent in the middle of the
        night. When morning comes she finds him gone along with her headband.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">The gate is still locked so the group climbs the walls. Once inside though they discover why the city crashed in the
        first place. There is chaotic energy radiating through the city causing things like immortal parrots, floating globes
        of water with fish swimming in it, and stone walls occasionally ripple like a flag in the wind. Exploring the city
        they discover the source of all the chaos is a huge stone pillar. As they are trying to figure out what to do about
        it they hear a noise from between a couple buildings. A huge amorphous creature is coming towards them. It turns
        out that the stone had summoned a creature of pure chaos, a Shoggoth. Hundreds of years ago the people of the city
        heard about a great evil in the land. Fearing this evil they turned to the stone for power against the evil. The
        stone warped the city and its people in the process and summoned the Shoggoth which brought the city down. After
        they defeat the Shoggoth the stone is weakened enough that they are able to destroy it with a dispel magic spell.
        The stone crumbles and they hear clapping and cheering from a bluff overlooking the battlefield. It is Jarlaxle and
        the Knight Lights. TVHG is badly injured from their fight with the creature so they aren't much up for fighting to
        get the headband back. They use persuasion to convince the Knight Lights that their employer is up to no good. When
        the Knight Lights begin to turn on Jarlaxle he escapes by using a magic item to create a tunnel below himself and
        drop down.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">The chaos of the stone created rifts that pulled members of the old city in. From the crumbled remains of the stone
        stand some of the original member of the ruling council of the city. They begin surveying the city and realize that
        it is still in working order but some of the magic items that allow the city to work are missing. Turns out that
        the Shoggoth made everyone fled and kept looter from destroying the city. The first item is a metal rod that can
        capture and store lightning bolts, this was the original protection and power for the city. The second item they
        will need to find to get the city to work again is a bag that has a portal to the plane of wind, this provides the
        lift for the city.</p>

      <h3>Canidae Copse</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">Since the group didn't have any leads on where to find these items they had nothing really to do till then. Rouge decided
        that now would be a good time to officially adopt Bearington. TVHG travel to her village on the West coast. Both
        the village and forest it is in are named Canidae Copse. Some things to know about Kitsune. First they are an all-female
        race. Males born from a kitsune are always the fathers’ race and females are always the mothers. Second they have
        a huge focus on childbearing in their culture. Third they live in family units and non kitsune in the community are
        rare. Because of the second and third points males coming to the village get a lot of attention from the kitsune
        women. During the night there are stories told around the campfire to scare the children. One of them is about the
        headless armor. It appears in towns and the townsfolk disappear.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">When the group gets there it happens to coincide with a festival so the group expects to find merriment but instead
        there is a lot of tension and hostility among the hostility. During the talks with the Matron mother about adoption
        she says that new comers to the community have to prove themselves to be accepted. The task she has in mind is that
        the forest they live in has become tainted as of late. She asks them to remove it.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">As the group ventures into the forest they notice that some of the trees are warped and blackened confirming the matron’s
        suspicions. There are small creatures called Leshys tending to these trees trying to stop the spread of infection.
        Up ahead they see large figures flitting about between the trees in the distance. Winged abominations that swoop
        down and attack the party. Venturing further one of the trees attacks as they walk beneath its boughs. As they come
        to the center of the infection they see more of the winged creatures up ahead and one that is larger than the rest
        that seems to be controlling the rest. During the ensuing battle they see another figure appear. It is a large tree
        spirit that the locals refer to as the goddess of the forest. She helps by restoring the party during the fight.</p>

      <h3>Cantankerous Captain Kurth</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">The group had heard of a legendary pirate from Kaer Maga who has control of the wind. Entering the city they begin
        trying to gather information. They hear that Captain Kurth has been one of the high captains for over 200 years despite
        being only human. He has a manor in the town but never sets foot in the town. While they are in one of the taverns
        gathering information there is a raucous dwarf in a corner boasting about how he is going to kill Captain Kurth but
        he hates boats. The group sits with him and begins asking him about why he is going to do so. He responds that he
        was hired by someone and then gets distracted and seems to be talking to an imaginary figure. The dwarf says "Oh
        he says if you want you can take over the contract to kill the ship rat. Here is a boat to get out to sea." and proceeds
        to toss them a long shallow wooden box. The group understandably looks at him like he is crazy. The dwarf then says
        "Oh and if you actually do it he says there is an added bonus for you". The group equal parts confused and intrigued
        asks the dwarf his name. "I am the great Athrogate! Bounty hunter and murderer for money extraordinaire. I am sure
        you have heard of me." After the run in with Athrogate they head to the docks. Figuring it is just a joke they throw
        the wooden box into the water. To their surprise it begins expanding into an actual boat big enough for a dozen people.
        Maybe the dwarf wasn't so crazy after all.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">TVHG spent a couple days at sea before seeing their intended target in the distance. Kurth’s ship has heading directly
        up wind at them. When it got close enough they realized their miscalculation. The pirate ship was way larger than
        their own and they had no offensive ranged weapons besides Lilith’s fireballs. Kurth’s ship pulled up to theirs broadside
        to show the cannons and ballista’s and a voice began shouting out demanding them to drop their weapons. Without any
        way to counterattack or prevent a cannonball from sinking them the group did as they were told. As the ship moved
        closer to send people down Rouge shrank down to her fox form and had Thomas throw her onto the ship. From there she
        began trying to take out the people manning the weapons. The rest of the group in the confusion began making their
        way up the boarding ladder to the top deck as well. As they take out the crew on the deck it becomes apparent that
        they haven't seen or fought the captain. Knocking on the captain’s cabin they hear him inside "I told you not to
        bother me Jack. How do you expect me to have you replace me when I retire if you can't handle that dinky ship." Turns
        out that Captain Kurth is just a title passed down from one person to another. That is how it has survived for so
        long. When the group finally gets him out of the cabin he is drunk off his ass and doesn't put up much of a fight.
        They sail back to Kaer Maga for the reward from Athrogate.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">When they get back to the city and are walking to the bar they first met Athrogate in they see a few of the buildings
        up ahead have collapsed. Getting closer there are hunks of green crystal in the center of the destruction. The townspeople
        are avoiding getting close to the area like they are afraid of it. When asked they just say that the building there
        was blown apart as a green tower was raised in its place and maybe half an hour after it appeared it crumbled.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">Upon entering the bar they see the dwarf in the corner where he was before but there is an odd figure sitting with
        him. Before they have a chance to hail the dwarf the figure turns around like he expected them to come in the door.
        "Welcome my friends!" He then says to the rest of the room "These are the ones who captured Captain Kurth"</p>

      <h3>Hephaestus Home</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">Jarlaxle thanking them for their deed says “I promised payment, and here it is” just then a fetchling appears next
        to the group seemingly from thin air and hands Inva the headband taken from her.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">By Jarlaxle’s own words after his run in with the group and stealing Inva’s headband he went to the Suntington manor
        and rummaged about taking a powerful green crystal showing it to the group. The crystal is a clear match to the crystal
        rubble in town. Inva recognizes it as Crenshinibon an intelligent magic crystal that her grandparents had worked
        to stop and capture in the past. It was on display in the manor’s study when Jarlaxle took it (under magical protection
        of course). Jarlaxle says that he had tried to use it to make a home for himself in the city of Kaer Maga but the
        evil of the item quickly became apparent and he had stop. He believes that the only way to destroy an item of such
        potent magic is to use even more powerful destructive magic, he goes on to suggest the flames of a great and terrible
        dragon by the name of Hephaestus who lives to the south.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">Athrogate turns down the adventure to the dragon’s lair saying, “I’m immortal but not THAT immortal”. When pressed
        on the immortality he just says he got it by “Twisting a wizards bum hairs”. Thoroughly confused and more than a
        little grossed out the group drops the line of questioning the dwarf. Asking why they should help the strange man
        out of the mess he created in the first place, he offers them each a magical ring for completing the task. Skeptical
        about him actually giving them items Jarlaxle offers to give them the rings upfront as it will help in their survival.
        Once again a fetchling male suddenly appears next to him and drops rings into his hand. He then holds each up for
        the group to slip their hand into. All perfect fits of course. As they are about the leave the bar though there is
        another Fetchling man that joins them walking out. He says his name is Kimmuriel, Jarlaxle’s second in command and
        he will be joining them for the journey. </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">Outside the city there are many abandoned farms but one seemingly abandoned farm has a couple cows grazing behind it.
        Jarlaxle drags the group to the front door and on the way a child is spotted hiding under the slats of the porch.
        Kimmuriel conjures an illusion of a snake to scare the child but as it materializes Jarlaxle whips a dagger into
        it destroying the illusion and shortly after the dagger disappears as well. The child is scared from what just happened
        but holds it in well, not making a peep. Jarlaxle gives a look at Kimmuriel like similar actions will have the next
        dagger aimed at him instead.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">Rapping on the door there is no response at first. Jarlaxle then pulls a gold key out of the pocket of his vest and
        inserts it into the lock and opens the door. A woman bursts out of the door with a fire poker raised. Jarlaxle is
        ready though and easily sidesteps leaving poor Thomas to receive the blow. She raises it again for another swing
        but Jarlaxle grabs the tool stopping her. “Might I ask for a glass of milk?” Turning to the watching group “One for
        each of us.” The mother complains saying that she hasn’t enough to spare. “I would be willing to pay of course. 1
        gold per glass. Yes?” He of course is already stepping through the door to the house. The woman worried about his
        intensions follows and begins pouring glasses of milk for each of the “visitors”. As she does Jarlaxle takes out
        a white handkerchief and places it on the table. It is a short stay with Jarlaxle asking what happened to the child’s
        father. Turns out that he had turned a couple years back to help support the family but had been killed in a fight
        with pirate hunters from the city of Waterdeep to the North. Jarlaxle goes to pay the woman and she say “I can’t
        go to the market with gold pieces, world will spread and I will end up with bandits.” Jarlaxle responds with “but
        of course” and tips his hand up with the gold pieces in it so that the 8 gold coins go down his sleeve. He then takes
        his other arm and directs it towards the table and 80 silver pieces come tumbling out of his other sleeve. “Is silver
        alright?” the woman wide eyed at the trick stammers for a second “Y-You really over estimate our situation”. “Sorry
        again.” He then slides the silver pieces into his palms again and tips them into his waiting sleeve. What comes forth
        the next time is 800 copper pieces raining down on her table. “Phew. You don’t have any smaller units than copper
        do you?” as he shakes a stubborn coin loose. The woman, done with his antics politely but firmly asks them all to
        leave her home. Jarlaxle takes his handkerchief off the table and there is a silver platter of food underneath piled
        high with fresh fruit. The mother begins to baulk to him about it. Jarlaxle of course says “Oh my no. Thank you very
        much but I couldn’t stay” The child who was watching in the doorway ducks out into the yard as the party turns to
        follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">Knowing his penchant for magical items Rouge gives her valuables to Lilith for safekeeping and heads to Jarlaxle’s
        tent to try to understand his motivations. </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px"></p>

      <h3>Nohanna</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">Taking a shortcut through the woods the group comes to an overgrown dirt road. There are saplings growing on it now
        but the ruts of wagons and carriages are there. It goes in the general path they are heading so instead of walking
        in the woods any further they take the old path. Not too long after they come to an old welcome sign for a village
        named Vikmordere. Exploring one of the houses on the edge of town the door is locked and everything is gone including
        the furniture. A wall in the living room has the words “Don’t touch it! Don’t let it touch you!” carved into the
        wood. A few more houses on the outskirts are explored with similar results with similar words carved on walls or
        on the outside of the houses. Approaching the center of town they see a large house with the front door smashed in
        and a bureau seen in the hallway beyond. Whatever happened in this town, the rest of the houses had enough time to
        escape and remove valuables but this house didn’t meet the same fate. The furniture is still there, the table in
        the dining room even has the dishes and silverware set for a meal. The group after doing a sweep of the first floor
        and finding nothing out of place begins moving up the stairs. Opening the first door there is… a storage closet.
        Complete with mop, broom, bucket and cleaning products. The group apparently perplexed why people would want cleaning
        products for their house begin inspecting each item seeing if I hid anything in here. </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">Cameron: “I fiddle with the bucket. Is there anything weird with it?”</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">Johnny: “I don’t know, roll something to fiddle with it.” </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">Cameron: “What skill is fiddling?”</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">Someone else: “Perform!”</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">Johnny: “You are a bard right? Fiddle should be a class skill”</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">This is how we had Fiddle as a skill in our games for a while</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">Moving on they open the door to the master bedroom. Judging from the clothes in the closet the family was probably
        the ones in charge of the town. Next room has the handle ripped off the door. Looking through the room inside seems
        to have been a girl’s room. The walls were painted pink, there are curtains in the window, and standing in the corner
        of the room there is an empty suit of armor. Or it would be empty if the armor didn’t start moving. The group opens
        the door and filing in. The armor doesn’t have a helmet so they can see inside and confirm that it is empty. The
        armor raises its fist and a ghostly blue Warhammer begins materializing in its hand. This is the headless armor that
        people tell of to scare children and it is standing in front of them. As Bearington walks in though the armor throws
        the hammer down shattering the floor below. It then begins stumbling towards him on weak and unsteady legs with its
        arms outstretched. The rest of the group gives him a wide berth to avoid this creature. Bearington unsure of what
        to do when faced with the thing of children’s nightmares stands there. As the armor gets to him, it puts its gauntlets
        on top of his head and begins stroking his ears. He responds by reaching up to the opening of the armor and his paws
        meet resistance. As he watches a small blonde girl’s face appears before him inside the armor. She says “NO!” The
        rest of the group begins asking what he sees. He tells them that after he touched her he could see and hear her.
        They all step forward to do the same and she is revealed to all of them. To try to figure out what is happening Rouge
        tells the little girl to look out the window to see Madeline who is now big enough that she pulls the groups cart
        of supplies. The girl looks out and seeing the dog raises her fists and smashes down the wall to jump out of the
        second story hole to where the dog is. Madeline, scared begins growling and goes to bite the armored girl who doesn’t
        even seem to notice, continuing to pet the dog while whispering “no, no, no, no.” It seems that is all she can say.
        The group decides to take her with them (like they had a choice with how strong she is and they have multiple animals
        she adores). They leave the town and that night while at the campfire for dinner try offering this strange girl food
        but she doesn’t even know what to do with it. They eventually get her to put it in her mouth and she enjoys the taste
        but when she is done with it just opens her mouth to let it drool out. Whatever she is she doesn’t eat. Later when
        it is time to sleep she doesn’t understand that either. Poor Bearington and Madeline don’t get much sleep after this
        point because she doesn’t sleep either.</p>

      <h3>Summersdale</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">One of TVHG had heard of the city of Summersdale not too far off that always has a lightning storm on top of it. They
        head off to try to figure out if it is related to the item that powers the city. As they approach the city the storm
        on top of it is looming and the sound is deafening. As they make their way through the streets the townspeople flee
        inside their houses at the sight of them. The lightning bolts from the storm are only striking one building in the
        center of town, it is almost constant strikes. By the time they make their way to the city center they see an armed
        group gathered there awaiting their approach. The mob of people is made up of townspeople for the inner portions
        and clergy members on the outside to defend them. A woman is standing in the front of the group, clad in black iron
        armor with a matching scythe she is spinning in her hands. Few things about this city. First it is built on one of
        the largest Cold Iron mines in the world. Second about a hundred years ago a demon by the name of Eertu Balor attacked
        the city in order to stop the production of cold iron as it is particularly effective against his kind. He was stopped
        but the rift that he opened in the earth for his invasion is still there letting smaller demons through. It has come
        to be known as the World Wound. Third the city is run by the church which protects against the demons. The figure
        head of the church is called the Arbiter. They are outfitted in the best armor and given a holy weapon. This woman
        in the front is the Arbiter. The townspeople see the group and immediately notice that Lilith has demon ancestry.
        Hence the less than warm welcome. Fourth there has started to be sightings of undead in town.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">After some bravado-ing around the group has found out that the Arbiter is named Holly Bredove. Lilith had to lie of
        course about her demon ancestry since it was her great grandfather who caused the rift in the first place. It is
        also discovered that the reason for the lighting striking the chapel tower is the lightning binder is up there. The
        power from the lightning binder is being channeled into another magical item, the Thread of Life. The thread is being
        used to bind the World Wound. Removing the Lightning Binder would leave the thread underpowered and unable to bind
        the wound anymore, releasing the full force of the demons. The group ends up staying in the town a few nights to
        try to figure out a solution.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">During the night a member of the group is in the graveyard to try to figure out what is going on and ends up spotting
        Holly on her patrol during the night. As they are following her she stops at one of the graves and pulls out what
        turns out to be the Life Thread. She uses it to raise the corpse. As it stands up she slays it and the group member
        confronts her about it. It is discovered that she wants to resurrect her dead husband. He was one of the Arbiters
        before her. She believes that with enough power she can bring him back. She has been testing the thread and how much
        would be needed to bring someone back completely. If she used the full power of the thread though it would completely
        open the wound though.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">The group offers their services as well as the services of their allies to help secure the rift once it is open. With
        multiple Arbiters and the extra forces it is believed that they should be able to close it completely. Rouge recruits
        her clan, Thomas and Castiel recruit their villages, Benevolence recruits her grandfather as well as Kronk and Snarl.
        Holly sets up in the church to do the resurrection and the rest of the party is at the rift ready for what is to
        come out. As the rift expands more and more powerful demons make their way through. After fighting off wave after
        wave of them they can feel something bigger clawing its way through. What emerges is a large winged demon wielding
        a burning whip in one clawed hand and a sword in the other. Krunk and Snarl move to fight it but as they get in range
        the demon with astonishing quickness side steps and beheads Krunk. Lilith in her heart recognizes this demon for
        what it is, who it is. It is her great grandfather Eertu Balor, the Demon that opened the portal in the first place.
        He moves towards the party with pounding steps and begins to address the group but stops short smelling something
        in the air... His progeny. Turning to Lilith he asks her "Why do you raise a sword against me and my forces? You
        belong by my side slaughtering this filth. You are of my own brood."</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">This naturally surprises the rest of the group as they didn't know anything about Lilith’s ancestry since she had kept
        it as a closely guarded secret. Lilith responds with "I cannot abide by what is going on and will not allow any harm
        to come to the town or her friends" Eertu gives a hearty laugh at this and begins his assault. Part way through Holly
        and Lucen make their way to the battlefield and throw cold iron weapons to the group and begin taking out their decades
        of frustration for the sadness and pain that they suffered at the hands of his kind. Upon his death Eertu's body
        begins to burn. Balors when slain on the material plane return to their own plane in a burst of flame. So that happens,
        almost taking some of the party members lower on health with it.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">With their balor general vanquished the rest of the demons ranks scatter or are cut down. Before long though it is
        the time to take stock of the loss of the day. Many former mortals are strewn about the battlefield. Theodore Suntington
        moves to his beheaded mount Krunk. Long ago it was he that brought him to be so it isn't much to reconstruct him
        again. The victory is bittersweet as the city may lose a few dozen a year to the demons but they have just lost hundreds
        to quell it. None the less they are thankful for the aid of the group as it will soon mean the end of the threat.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">The Lightning Binder and Life thread are taken from their places in the chapel and brought to the field. The thread
        has shortened considerably in the resurrection of Lucen Bredove. The thread is then woven through the edges of the
        rift, barely making it the whole way around before running out of thread. The end of the thread is tied to the Lightning
        Binder and it is levitated for the storm to recharge. A great lightning bolt comes down striking the binder. The
        thread begins cinching the rift closed while the lightning sears the edges like cauterizing a wound. After a couple
        more lightning strikes the World Wound is closed and all that is left is a furrow of ground and scorched earth. Lilith
        as thanks for her help in the battle is given the sword that originally drove Eertu back hundreds of years ago. Balor
        Bane. With the rift closed the lightning binder is no longer needed by Summersdale. TVHG takes it back to Ulduvai.
        So concluded our first year of gaming.</p>
