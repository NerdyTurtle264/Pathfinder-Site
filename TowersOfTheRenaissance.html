				Vision) who
				favors
				fire magic but is very comfortable on the water sailing and swimming. Her vision is closer to infrared
				than true
				sight
				but she can perceive quite well in the dark. She also loves horses. She loves music but is discrete
				about it
				until
				she
				finds a music friend to play/sing with her. She and her brothers have a sibling band that’s popular in
				the small
				tavern
				in their hometown. Her primary music doing is singing but she is interested in learning the fiddle.
				Honerva
				loves a
				good

				boys was
				tough.
				Magnus had to learn from a young age to wrestle and grow strong in order to defend himself against his
				four
				older
				brothers,
				Silvius, Quirinus, Aelius, and Marius, especially as they grew older and joined the military themselves,
				coming
				back
				bigger and stronger each time. In full contrast to his loud and frankly obnoxious brothers, Magnus was

				with his
				friend
				Serena at her home.

				Serena
				had
				no
				time for that, choosing mischief and pranks instead. When she approached the proper age, her mother went
				so far
				as
				to
				suggest that the family could somehow pay their way out of Serena’s military service. Serena was furious
				at the
				idea
				and insisted that she go. The two argued about whether she should go up until the moment that Serena
				left home
				for
				the
				base, and they’ve been on poor terms since. Her father tried to make peace between them, but his work
				and
				absence
				kept
				him from being effective at the endeavor.

			<h1>Prologue</h1>
			<p>
				Patriam suffered a magic plague 500 years ago where all magic was neutralized. The people in the time
				since have
				been developing
				technological means of accomplishing the same sort of effects however. In a land devoid of magic
				including
				healing
				magic
				the people have adapted to this wholeheartedly and even have begun to incorporate technology into their
				own
				bodies,
				sometimes
				as a way of replacing limbs lost in battle, sometimes as a symbol of their class. The people of this
				land are
				scared
				and proud of it. The cause of the magic plague is lessening now though and magic is beginning to have a
				resurgence.
				Some
				are using it for it's original purposes and some are using it to power technological creations never
				thought
				possible
				before. The country has a conscription service for the citizens. Everyone has to spend 10 years in the
				military
				once
				they reach the age of adulthood. After the 10 years people can choose to stay in the service of their
				country
				and
				many
				do. You will all be playing members of the Patriam military at the start of their career assigned to a
				smaller
				unit
				towards
				the border of the country.

		<div class="w3-content w3-padding">
			<h1 class="w3-center">Our Story</h1>
			<h3>Getting to Base First</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">We start everything off as the players are on their way to the military base
				they will be stationed at. It is a small base towards the south on the outskirts of a town named
				Theodin. It is a peaceful part of the country by the border with Merra. The travel there isn’t too
				difficult, the only conflict being with native wildlife.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">When they get to the base Major Desma and Captain Ignacio are outside waiting
				for them. They introduce themselves and begin showing the group around the grounds. When the tour is
				over the group is told to feel free to explore the base and become acquainted with everyone there and
				the layout. Serena goes to the armory to check it out and meets Jynx who is startled by the entry and
				when she goes to turn around she trips with a loaded firearm which goes off ricocheting around the room
				and knocks embers from the forge onto the floor.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">When the group is done exploring they are taken to a local cave for a training
				exercise. The are randomly put into sections of a cave and have to fight. This goes poorly when Magnus
				ends up severely injuring Cassius and the exercise is halted.</p>

			<h3>Missing Kids</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">A couple days pass and the first mission comes in. There is a town in the
				nearby area that has had a couple kids and an old woman disappear. The group sets out in the morning and
				gets there as the sun is about to set. Desma goes to talk to the most recent victims family and the
				group is tasked with searching for clues.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">They end up finding a makeshift fort built in the woods not too far away. There
				is also a spot next to a tree with cigar butts and tracks from smooth soled boots. Someone recognizes
				the type of tobacco in the cigars as a strain grown in Sandora. Someone else finds out that the town
				used to have a mine in the area and figures that is probably where the kids were taken.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">When they confront the Sandoran slavers it is revealed that Desma’s arm is on a
				chain and has a launching mechanism that when it hits something the hand locked closed. She uses this to
				grab people from a distance and drag them in to attack in melee. Magnus ends up picking up an
				interesting dagger from one of the minions.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Instead of taking the kids back to the base for questioning they take the old
				woman since she would probably be a better witness and they didn’t want to take the kids away from their
				families so soon after getting saved.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">When they get back to the base they find Olek outside waiting. He goes to help
				the old woman down from the cart and as he does there is an audible *pop* as his back goes out. He
				manages to keep a straight face though and is able to hand her off to someone else to lead into the
				base.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">*While everyone else was away from base on the mission Cassius ended up having
				to stay back due to his injuries in the cave. While he is there he goes to head to town and spots Olek
				on the trail up ahead. He quickly overtakes him and begins trying to make small talk. Olek does so for a
				bit but after a while he stops on the trail and says “We have to go back. My rheumatism is acting up
				again.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius is confused but unwilling to argue and so the two head back to base. As
				soon as they get back to base Olek bars the front door and asks Cassius if he ”saw them!?” They begin
				locking all the doors and windows then make their way to the armory where he has the girls work on a way
				for them to see out.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Jynx says she will make a “peri-glass” and begins fitting mirrors into pipes
				lying around and then drills a hole in the roof. Upon looking out a suspicious figure is caught watching
				the base around a tree. The base begins making preparations for an assault.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">As night is about to set a voice is heard yelling for everyone inside to
				surrender. Olek begins spouting off something about “The Frozen Inch” and how he would never surrender.
				The outside group respond as would be expected and begin knocking down the doors.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Olek orders the rest of the base to defend the Western half and he will protect
				the Eastern. To Cassius’s surprise he actually does. He stands in the middle of the hallway with his
				cane and his fighting style is rather unorthodox as he waits for his opponents to attack and counter
				attacks using their power against them.*</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The next day the group heads into town to help Olek do his shopping for the
				base. When he gets there he is immediately swarmed with kids who tease him about hurting his back in
				between trying to haggle him to pay them for carrying the stuff he buys or pushing his wheelchair. Olek
				boasts saying that he was injured defeating 50 men. The kids scoff and Calida begins telling an even
				more outlandish tale about how it happened than what Olek told them.</p>

			<h3>Olek’s Retirement</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">As the days pass Olek doesn’t end up feeling much better. He decides that this
				will be it. He must finally retire. Everyone begins trying to find something to give him for his
				retirement.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida makes him a stained glass ornament of the base symbol.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius makes a reinforced cane for him so he can smack people with it better,
				etching it so it is decorative as well.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva helps Fulvia make a seat cushion.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Magnus goes to bring the old woman who he was interested in for his party.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena gets a book for the local children to sign for him.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Ignacio gets him a book for him to write his tales in.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Desma collects news clippings of his exploits “to remember what actually
				happened”.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Jynx and Hyde make him a special wheelchair that can climb stairs (and has
				rocket boost courtesy of Jynx).</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cadoc prepares the food for the festivities (a wonderful grilled steak with
				vegetables and for desert a delicious carrot cake.)</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The children put together a play of one of Olek’s battles. The play almost ends
				in a fight though as the children begin arguing about what happened since Olek has told so many
				different versions. Just as it is about to escalate Olek stands up and begins clapping “Wonderful!
				That’s exactly how I remember it!” The parents then swoop in and quell the children and start prepping
				them to go home.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">One of the tables at the party consists of some of Olek’s old comrades. Zaren
				his friend he would stand shoulder to shoulder with on the front lines is almost as stooped as Olek is.
				Fieri an elven alchemist hasn’t changed much. And Disuos a human who ended up being an ambassador to
				Tian Xia. The final member of their party, Quill, nobody seems to know the whereabouts of since he
				retired and Fieri seemed glad he hadn’t shown up.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The party is interrupted though when the table in front of Desma begins to warp
				as a mouth appears and says “Desma Fide, I have a message for you” as it spits a scroll in her
				direction. As she reads the scroll her face contorts in anger and she crumples the note in her fist and
				slams it on the table before storming out of the tavern.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Ignacio quickly reads the letter before heading out to follow her. When the
				party is over the group heads back to base and as it comes into view they see the destruction that Desma
				left in her wake through the training grounds. The dummies have all been smashed and half of one is even
				spotted on the roof of the base.</p>

			<h3>Under New Management</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">It is discovered that Olek’s replacement has already been decided. A man by the
				name of Stain. He was the man who poorly led the battle that Desma ended up breaking rank in to save her
				unit. Desma and Ignacio are furious that he has been stationed above them again thinking that he is
				coming out of revenge for her insubordination. The matter is made worse by the fact that Desma is almost
				constantly getting letters sent to her by the man as he makes his way to the base.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The day that he is to arrive the caravan is spotted in the distance and the
				seal of the honor guard is on the side of the carts. One of the carts begins having the horses sprinting
				and the rest follow suit but it is too late the first cart has too much of a lead and easily gets there
				before the rest.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">A man hops down from the front of the cart and the soldier that was next to him
				tries to protest saying that there is a procedure for this. The man waves him away and says that it is
				their fault that it took so long for him to get here in the first place. It is important to note that
				traveling from the capitol to the base takes a week usually and they made it in 4 days.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The man tells them all to get out of here so he can start to work. The honor
				guard complies and begins heading down the path away from the base. The man then turns to the group and
				introduces himself as Brigadier General Stain. Once he is done meeting the members of the base Desma and
				Ignacio lead him on the tour of the base. When they are spotted walking around it is easily noted that
				Stain has the look of someone who has gotten stuck walking behind a particularly slow group on a narrow
				sidewalk.</p>

			<h3>Giants In A Giant Cave And One Particularly Giant Giant</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">That night a report comes in about Giants raiding caravans in the area. Stain
				decides that this would be a great opportunity to see everyone in action so he takes the whole group
				along. Someone brings up that the base would be left defenseless so Stain gets the bright idea to send a
				message to the honor guards to turn back and come defend the base… poor honor guards.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">On the road to the giant cave Jynx is sitting on top of a small cart with a
				tarp on it pulled behind one of the horses.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">When the giant cave is spotted Jynx begins setting up “Pow-Pow Jr” as Cassius
				is sent to get the giants attention and bring them within range. As soon as Cassius gets to safety Jynx
				begins her barrage leaving all of the ones that left the cave dead. It leaves the group in awe of the
				power and the joy that Jynx seems to have unleashing it.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The group makes their way into the cave killing several more giants. When they
				get to the last section there are several giants all grouped up together and one of them is at least 5
				feet taller than the rest. He is probably the leader. Stain decides that he will take that one on
				personally racing past the others.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The two are a close match but Stain comes out the winner after several rounds
				quite injured. He then proceeds to pick up Magnus and toss him at one of the remaining giants. With the
				last of the giants slain Magnus goes over to the largest of them and pulls a black tower shield off of
				it that it had been using as a buckler. The shield has dwarven ruins carved into it. After fighting the
				giant one on one Stain is rather injured but turns down healing, instead he opens his safe and pulls out
				a vial of black liquid and drinks it. His wounds close up a bit afterwards and that night he is seen
				reading from a massive tome but he claims that he is just writing in his journal.</p>

			<h3>Home Invasion</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain refuses to go to a military meeting and instead sends Desma and Ignacio.
				While they are gone the group is training and decides to invite Stain to join them but they can’t find
				him. Since he is away it is decided that they should do some snooping.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius decides to leave a potion of invisibility lying around for someone else
				to use. Serena decides that she will do the snooping and have Honerva be lookout. Serena unlocks the
				office door and begins going through drawers and finds that he dumped all of his medals into one of the
				drawers and the rest of them are empty.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain doesn’t have much in terms of personal items so there isn’t much to find
				in his office. She decides to go into the bedroom portion and in the chest at the foot of the bed finds
				Stains safe. Looking it over there isn’t a keyhole, there also isn’t a mechanism to open it except for
				the hand grooves that are worn into the door where he apparently pries it open every time.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">She decides to put it back and continue searching and eventually take another
				look out in the office. While she is there though the front door of the base is heard smashing. In less
				than two seconds his is in front of Honerva grabbing her by the front of the shirt and dragging her into
				his office past the invisible Selena and aggressively telling her “Face to the floor now.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">She complies and Serena feeling bad goes in to try to calm the situation. Stain
				notices that there was no sound from the door to the office just the knocking on the bedroom door. He
				opens the door and tells her the same thing as Honerva.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Eventually the rest of the players except for Magnus make their way to the
				floor of the bedroom and are questioned one by one. Cass is being particularly asinine and ends up with
				a few bruises. To everyone’s surprise Stain doesn’t punish them for what they did and even when Desma
				gets back makes no mention of it.</p>

			<h3>Merran Madness Comes To Patriam</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The group is then contacted by a messenger about the sound of explosions from
				outside his hometown. The group heads out immediately to try to figure out what is going on. Due to the
				significance of the situation the group ends up taking a shortcut through a swamp and getting attacked
				by a giant alligator.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">When they finally get to the area in question the ground is littered with
				craters and the glow of a campfire can be seen through the trees up ahead. Serena scouts ahead to see
				what is going on. She finds two male half-orcs and two human females sitting around the fire.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">One of the half-orcs looks in her direction and she is compelled to walk up to
				the group. He then says ”We have plenty to eat if you are hungry.” Serena yelled and the rest of the
				group comes running to help. Stain gets there first and said “You are bad at this” while picking her up
				and whispering “check out the rest of the area” before tossing her away from the camp.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">As Stain and the leader of this group talk the group begins talking to the
				others from the campfire. Turns out they are merchants from Merra coming up to sell magical items. Stain
				pulls out some of his pay checks and begins buying some of the magical items.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Eventually it is decided to continue searching the area for clues and while
				passing by one of the craters Cassius notices that the dirt in the bottom gives off a very minor purple
				sheen, so he begins taking samples and performing experiments. When he adds acid to the sample in a
				glass tube it fizzles and then melts its way through the glass. When sparked it causes an explosion.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain then orders to stop messing with it and get back to work. After circling
				the area looking for prints and not finding any they decide to try to talk with the merchants again but
				when they get to the campfire the people are gone.</p>

			<h3>Turtle Tumult</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The start of the day Stain says that he will be taking over training for the
				base. Everyone will have to participate. For the next 4 days everyone will be spending 8 hours a day
				training. Most have strength and endurance training but others have breathing exercises to steady their
				aim. Cassius has a particularly harsh training regime but is too stubborn to complain about it to Desma
				and refuses to admit it to Stain.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">On the fifth day they are told to “relax but be ready”. Stain can be spotted on
				top of the stables after breakfast keeping lookout. Eventually the sound of loud singing and marching
				can be heard down the path.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">As the group gathers they can see an odd sight. There is a dwarf riding on top
				of a turtle phalanx formation, singing and drinking. When they come within range Stain shouts to the
				group “This will be a competition between the lowest ranked of the base and the trainees of the dwarf
				brigade. If they make it to the base we lose. You have to flip them.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The group is rather unsure of how to proceed at first. Trying to blast it with
				fireballs, tie them up with rope, shooting at the shields. Eventually Honerva gets up to it and forces a
				fireball through a small gap and the pressure pops it up off the ground. Magnus and Serena knock it to
				fall on one side more than the other and Honerva pushes it to fall the rest of the way over winning the
				training competition.</p>

			<h3>Drunk and Disorderly</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">As the dwarven formation flips the number of them under their hits them along
				with the smell. These dwarves must have been marching days straight from the South to get here. As they
				unlock their shields and stand up Rein sidles up to Stain and whispers something to him "Who are you
				going by this time?"</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">After everyone is introduced the dwarves march off to the river to wash. When
				they get back they set up camp in the woods not far from the base using their shields as tents for
				themselves. Stain tells Rein that there is someone in town that would love to meet him.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">As the two are setting off to town most of the rest of the base goes along
				with. They are going to see Olek but as they get close Stain disappears from the group. On the way back
				to the base they go to the tavern to purchase ale for the dwarves and wine for everyone else.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Desma interjects that the wine won't be necessary since there is plenty in the
				base. When they get back to the base she goes to Ignacio and tells him to bring out about 10 bottles. He
				then goes to his locker and pulls out 10 fancy wooden boxes with "Ingenium Winery" carved into the side
				and begins opening them and throwing away the containers</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">During the meal Rein loudly says to Stain "I heard what you did to the boy.
				Wasn't taking his arm off a bit excessive?" Stain immediately shushes him and tells him to shut up about
				that. After that Desma and Ignacio are clearly uncomfortable. Not that the group would notice. They were
				drinking on the other side of the room and not doing well on their Fort saves.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida ends up oversharing about how she doesn't understand a lot of things on
				the surface, but she feels more at home here than she ever did in the Underdark. It is then decided that
				everyone should share a secret.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena reveals that she thinks Stain is hot (he overhears and gives a flirty
				wink back).</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva reveals that she is blind and that she likes Fulvia.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Magnus reveals that he has four brothers.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Jynx stands up and says "The stalactite wasn't an accident. I did it on purpose
				for Mother." Previously it was told that Jynx got her name because during an experiment in the Underdark
				she supposedly accidentally knocked down a massive stalactite and almost crushed an opposing Noble
				house. If anyone in the drow city found out about this, it would mean the destruction of the Tenebrae
				house.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The dwarf brigade not understanding the impact of such a revelation make a
				crack "darn mushroom elves can't handle their wine."</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida flips out at this and shouts at them "Rock munching Ibliths!" None of
				them know what that means though, so they just shrug and Calida is drunk enough that someone quickly
				distracts her.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva goes to their room to retrieve her wand of detect next of kin and
				sneakily casts it on Cassius - it is revealed to her that his father is a drow.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">As things wind down Cassius makes sure to stay in the dining hall to try to
				listen in on what is going on with Stain and Desma. When Stain walks into her office he creeps over and
				listens through the door. Desma asks "What is going on? Who was he talking about out there?"</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain meekly responds "It doesn't matter. He deserved it and you don't have to
				worry"</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Desma dripping venom shouts at him "THIS doesn't matter. You try to ruin
				someone’s career, their life, and it doesn't matter? Who was it this time?"</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">"Aurelious"</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Desma confused by this "The Lieutenant Colonel? In the interrogation I said it
				wasn't him. I acted on my own."</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">"No. It wasn't that. He was the one that wrote and signed your court martial
				behind my back. I was so asleep back then I didn't even pay enough attention to notice."</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">"...So it wasn't you? You really didn't come here for some sort of revenge?"
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">"No. I told you the truth back then why I am here. So will you finally accept
				my offer?"</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">"I still don't understand why you want this but fine. I accept."</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain excitedly says “Wonderful. I would like the announcement to be tomorrow
				morning.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The next day after breakfast it is announced that Stain is to be treated as a
				First Lieutenant and Desma will be in charge except when an outside member of the base is around.</p>

			<h3>Murder Party</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Word comes that the neighboring colony will be joining Patriam and the base
				will be going as representatives of the patraim military. Everyone goes to get fancy outfits for the
				event. When the day finally comes everyone arrives to the ball in a carriage. They get announced to the
				dance and take their tables.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Hyde takes Cassius around and hobnobs with some of the influential people at
				the other tables. While they are making their rounds they hear a commotion towards the entrance. A man
				is coming into the room and Stain is making a bee line for him.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">He says the man's name to get his attention "Aurelious! Great seeing you here.
				Let's go out where we can talk." As he says this he passes by the table with Desma and Ignacio who is
				standing up. Stain quickly rips off Ignacio's belt and pushes him back in his seat before going to
				Aurelious and ushering him out of the room.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius downs an invisibility potion and runs out to follow while Serena dashes
				out the back to figure out what is going on as well. Stain is so fast though that neither of them find
				him right away.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius finds Aurelious with Ignacio's belt in his mouth, he takes it out to
				let the man speak - he says something about how ‘She changed him’ along with a few other things. Cass
				lets Aurelious die unaided but takes the belt with him when he leaves to return to the ball.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena finds Stain in the back cleaning his hands in a fountain. The two of
				them make their way back into the ball where Cassius is spotted walking back in.</p>

			<h3>Cassius and Stain Team Building</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The day after the ball Desma hands out tasks to everyone but Cassius and Stain
				who she pulls aside. Cassius has been repeatedly spying on Stain since he showed up and that it has to
				stop if they are to be a properly working unit.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">She tells them that there is a shipment for Jynx in the next town and the two
				of them are going to be sent to get it for her early without their equipment as a team bonding exercise.
				Things start off okay with the two making the trek.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain is clearly nervous without his case and the further they get from base
				the worse Stain looks. By the time they get a little over halfway there Stain has to sit and take a
				break.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">They are accosted by a small group of ruffians who Cass tries to talk into
				leaving them alone. They aren't buying it and finally Cassius pulls the ‘You are making a grave mistake
				trying to attack the Great Brigadier General Stain’. Turns out the ruffians were actually sent to
				assassinate Stain so a scuffle ensues.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain tells Cass to dive when given the signal seeing that there is a deep
				puddle nearby. Cass puts himself near the water and is surrounded when Stain rips a medium tree up from
				its roots. Cassius dives into the puddle as Stain lets the tree fall on their attackers.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">When Cass comes up he realizes that Stain in now under the tree. Cassius
				manages to use another thick branch to lever the tree up enough to drag Stain out who is now
				unconscious. In a panic Cassius swigs a potion of strength and mutates, now giving himself the strength
				to carry Stain the rest of the way in a rush.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Upon arriving Cassius tears through the town trying to revive Stain but nothing
				is working, finally he commendeers the fastest horse they have yelling to bill the base as he rides back
				with Stain.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain comes awake as they near the base and is put in his room. Cassius snaps
				at Desma as he’s explaining what happened, clearly furious that they were practically defenseless during
				this assignment.</p>

			<h3>Fulvia's Proposal</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">It takes a few days for Stain to recover from the ordeal and Serena cares for
				him throughout. Ignacio helps Calida overcome her magic dyslexia. Turns out that Jynx wasn't a good
				teacher and that was the main reason Calida couldn't do magic. Fulvia asks Honerva to marry he so that
				she can become a citizen as well and Honerva accepts. When Cadoc finds out though he is very upset and
				disappointed that Fulvia will be leaving so he decides to take on the arena for his freedom, leaving the
				base. Magnus takes over the farm in his absence.</p>

			<h3>Base Boredom</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">In the coming days Cassius continues his experiments on the crystals with Hyde
				as his supervisor and the two develop a bond during it. </p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva is asked by Fulvia to marry her and the two begin preparations for the
				ceremony in the coming months. Ignacio and Calida announce their relationship to the base.</p>

			<h3>Tower Emergence</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius continues his experiments trying to unlock the secrets of the crystals.
				He asks the other members of the base who can cast magic to cast spells with and without the crystals to
				measure their effects on the different schools of magic.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px"></p>When it comes to conjuration he has Ignacio cast <a
				href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wall-of-stone/">Wall of Stone</a> thinking to create a
			defensive perimeter around the base. As the spell is cast with the crystal however, the wall begins to form
			but begins to morph stopping its growth lengthwise and gaining thickness as well as height till it is a
			massive black cylindrical tower ascending into the sky. The sunlight hitting the tower reflects with a
			purple sheen matching the crystals that were used to summon this monolith.</p>

			<h3>Tower of Athena</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The first room has two other doors and is dark, torches are lit and they see a
				small colorful owl on the ground in the middle of the room. It begins hopping over to the group who are
				apprehensive. It doesn’t make any aggressive moves though and after walking around Stain flies up and
				lands on his safe. Not sure what to do about it they go through the left door. Huddled inside the next
				room are a handful of small humanoid creatures covered in feathers and faces resembling that of owls. In
				response to the disturbance of the door being opened they all turn to see the group and start walking up
				to them hooting. Serena steps forward and begins offering her trail rations to them. At first this is
				fine but more of them keep stepping out from the darkness till there is a few dozen of them and they
				begin to get more and more aggressive for the food. Serena successfully intimidates them though and gets
				them to back off, she notices a particularly timid one that gives her puppy dog eyes. Serena takes this
				one and decides that she will keep it.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The second floor is an empty room but with perches around the edges with huge
				nests on top. As they make their way across massive owl heads pop out on top of the nests and the owls
				begin taking flight and swooping down on the group. During the fight, several of the group are carried
				off and separated from the rest.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">After the fight it is revealed that Hyde is actually Jynx in disguise because
				she wanted to have an adventure with everyone else.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">On the third floor there are square tiles of silver and on the other side an
				owlbear like creature sleeping. As soon as someone sets foot on the silver tiles the creature stirs and
				disappears into the floor in a surge of electricity. The fight is difficult because the creature would
				appear and disappear to attack so it didn’t give much opportunity to fight back.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The fourth floor was filled with strings of yarn as fine and strong as steel
				thread strung from wall to wall. When one is cut they all shift and risk cutting anyone inside. They end
				up finding eight levers along the edges and a loom in the middle that the yarn is going to. The group
				ends up figuring out the pattern for the levers and it is to flip them in the order that a spiders legs
				move in.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The next floor had statues of armed warriors in fighting positions, a low
				hissing sound, and hushed whispers. Cassius goes first and begins making his way past the statues and
				finds the source of the sounds. Medusa was on the other side and facing away from him. He decided to
				make a noise to announce his presence. She turned around surprised and Cassius couldn’t help but stare
				into her face because of the hissing snakes and begins turning to stone like all the other statues. The
				rest of the group comes up and Medusa apologizes before giving a vial of her tears to break the spell
				and answering any questions that she can and directing them further up.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">On the final floor they find themselves in a massive library and begin
				exploring till Magnus finds a huge owl looking like the night sky perched on the stacks above him. She
				reaches a set of talons down and grabs him by the armor on the scruff of his neck and carries him back
				to the center of the library. When the rest of the group gathers the owl morphs into a large woman with
				a similarly colored dress and introduces herself as Athena. She talks with the group and then asks Desma
				to have a private conversation with her and she agrees. A bolt of lightning strikes where the two of
				them stand and they are gone for a few minutes. When the appear the same way Calida goes to ask another
				question but Athena stops her and says that she can only keep the tower for a bit longer and they will
				have to leave before that happens.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Upon leaving the tower they see the remnants of explosions and attempts to get
				past the sealed door. There are new recruits at the base and Hyde as commanding officer comes to greet
				them.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Turns out time moves differently inside the tower. What the group experienced
				as only a few days passed as several months outside, and they were all presumed dead.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Everyone goes about drafting letters to send to their families and friends</p>

			<h3>Ruin on the Rails</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Everyone is given their mail and their back pay before being told to pack up
				and head out to go report to the capitol.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The group boards a train in town the next day marvelling over this new
				invention and wondering how it works.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva makes friends with a pair of young girls who are sisters on their way
				to meet their older sister.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Magnus hangs out in the kitchen cart</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Hyde begins briefing everyone on the technological advances that have been made
				in their absence. This is particularly distressing for Cassius as an alchemist and before she begins he
				reads his mail.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">There is a letter from his mother bearing the news that his grandfather’s
				estate had been leveled by what was described as a moving mountain. Everyone there - which was almost
				all his family aside from his parents- was killed. This came as crushing news since he was closest to
				his grandfather and Cass spends the rest of the time in a daze, not listening at all to Hyde’s
				explanations.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida notices this sudden change in disposition and sneaks a peek at the
				letter. She tells Hyde and tries to cheer him up but he isn't responding in his usual haughty manner.
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Hyde sits down with Cassius and slowly explains the scientific progress that
				has been made so he can start catching up. This does make it a bit better.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena and Stain use one of the sleeping cabins to have some fun.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida bribes an escort to use a different room to keep them from being walked
				in on.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">All in all, it is a fairly peaceful journey... not for long of course.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">There is a scream from the front of the train, launching the group into action.
				They begin making their way to the front but are stopped by one of the assistants in the baggage car.
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">They speak in a northern accent and refuse to let the group through. The
				assistant assures them that everything is under control and to stay calm and in their seats as the train
				comes to an unexpected stop.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva in the kitchen cart reassures the girls she’s been talking to that
				everything will be okay and that her team will take care of it. She and Magnus start making their way
				towards the front.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The group slowly returns to their seats but Cassius takes an invisibility and
				spider climb potion and stays on the ceiling of the car to observe.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The assistants start talking in a different language - northern and Cass takes
				a potion of comprehend language to understand what they're saying. They are in the process of robbing
				the train - specifically a large barrel of lacrima crystals which function as a highly volatile power
				source.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius tries to stall them and attract the groups’ attention by speaking and
				revealing that he’s there. The idiot alchemist somehow manages to stay alive long enough for the others
				to force their way through.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The thieves manage to get the barrel off the train as it begins to move again
				and threaten to blow it up as the group tries to go after them.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida signs in Drow Sign Language to let the others know what's going on.
				Cassius understands this and is relaying to everyone.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">They make their move and the thief makes good on her threat. The group isn't
				fast enough to stop the barrel from hitting the train tracks and exploding.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">In a daze everyone takes stock of the damage and the dead. Including little
				Olek from the town, the two girls that Honerva had made friends with, along with a few others. Everyone
				is in shock, trying to think of something to do when a strange glowing light comes through the trees.
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">A woman greets them and asks to speak to the elders among the passengers,
				taking aside the three older women that had been on the train. She trades their souls for the return of
				the young ones and the three youngest among the dead (the sisters and olivia) are returned to the
				living.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The mysterious woman walks off and disappears.</p>


			<h3>Capital Catastrophy</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Arriving in the capitol, Honerva finds out that the sisters are actually
				Fulvia’s younger sisters whom she is adopting. Honerva goes to find Fulvia.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Hyde, Desma, Stain, and a few others go to make reports while the others start
				heading towards Serena’s parents’. They find out that there is a murderer on the loose. All of the
				victims have been merchant families with an heir under the age of 10. The visit goes well, her parents
				are overjoyed that she is okay.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">They also go to Ignacio’s family and he introduces Calida as his significant
				other. He is the youngest of his many brothers.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">They decide to visit Cassius’ family as well, find that there are more drow
				guards than he remembers and they are impertinent when the group asks to meet with the heads of
				household. Eventually they are let in and are greeted reservedly. Cass questions his parents about the
				lack of heir and asking if they’d tried - his intentions being to make sure his absences weren't going
				to affect their safety due to the murderer.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">His mother is acting suspicious so they make plans to meet at a later date for
				lunch.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">They go visit Caddoc and find him fairly well-off. Everyone makes plans to go
				watch his next match.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva in the meantime gets to spend some quality time with Fulvia and her
				sisters.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">When they all meet up at the inn for dinner and bed, they are informed that
				there will be a ball in their honor where they will receive their new rank.</p>

			<h3>The Colosseum</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius meets with his mother and she informs him that not only is she pregnant
				with a child that may not be his father’s- she has inherited the entirety of the estate and business and
				she will not be giving it over to Cassius who was the original inheritor. This irritates Cass who snaps
				at her for having an affair and risking said business for no good reason. She then informs him that he
				has been completely cut out of their will and cut off from the family influence and funds. She leaves
				him shocked at the restaurant and he eventually goes to find the rest of the group, begrudgingly
				informing them of the new development.</p>

			<h3>Anxious Ball Ceremony</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Everyone is super nervous and there is a lot of chaos as everyone meets
				everyone else’s families and such.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Hyde has Cassius escort her around to meet with people.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Everyone is having a grand ol time.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">One by one everyone is called up to receive their new rank except for Cassius
				who is called up last. Stain unpins one of his own medals and pins it to Cass’ shoulder as a medal for
				saving the life of a superior officer during a mission.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius is a bit flabbergasted, especially when his mother approaches him with
				open arms. Hyde steps in and speaks to her, showering Cass with compliments and making his mother back
				off and (hopefully) feel horrible about disowning him.</p>

			<h3>Matron Confrontation</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The day after the ball Caminus goes out exploring and sees one of the factories
				and decides to try to sneak in. He gets into the work floor and sees someone giving a tour to someone.
				He comes around a workstation to confront him and sees that he is talking to Hyde. Caminus goes off on a
				rant about the evils of industrialization and ends up concussing one of the workers.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Spiros Vlahos from the ball the previous night recognizes the two of them
				though and comes down to welcome them. It is revealed that he plans on taking on one of the towers and
				has put in the paperwork to requisition the groups help. Hyde was originally there because she was asked
				to work on a new project for the country. Spiros plans to take the group off in less than a week and
				head West to the town of Lentie where there are two towers and one of them is open.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Caminus returns to the inn to rest.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena and Stain walk around the capital and she shows him all of her old
				haunts. As they leave a bar Stain starts taking her down some streets trying to find his bearings before
				stopping at an empty lot where the ground is covered in large stones. He goes over and begins prying one
				up to reveal a narrow staircase going underground. In the bottom is a room with all kinds of
				knick-knacks. “These are all things from my previous lives I couldn’t part with” He shows her a boxing
				guard that Olek got him, a cat collar from his first pet, and a folding chair from his mother.
				Eventually though they have to leave because a guard has spotted the weird hole in the ground and is
				poking around.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Magnus wasn't feeling well and has stayed in his room.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius is sitting with Jynx in her room, keeping her entertained with new
				science. A knock on the door has Cass opening it to reveal a large drow woman who looks extremely
				intimidating trying to force her way in. She shoves Cass aside who demands that she explain herself as
				he gets between her and Jynx. Jynx is now cowering against the wall away from the woman who is then
				revealed to be her mother. </p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius won't stand aside since Jynx is clearly scared, the Matron threatens
				him, giving orders to kill him if he fights. She casts a paralyzing spell on him and strikes him with
				her snake headed whip. It tears apart his shoulder and she pushes him aside so he falls - still
				paralyzed- and drags Jynx out of the room.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida and Ignacio go out to visit his family and have dinner with them. As
				they come back though they spot two drows standing at the entrance of the tavern preventing anyone from
				coming in and bothering the Matron Mother of house Tenebrae. They make their way around the building to
				spot more at the back. Stain and Serena arrive back then and Calida begins asking Stain for citizenship.
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain confused turns to Ignacio and Serena before saying “That isn’t my place.
				Plus, I have Serena.” Calida pleads with him for asylum from her Matron Mother inside. At this Stain
				marches up to the door and as a guard reaches for his sword, Stain reaches over and crushes the bones of
				the reaching hand before walking in.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The Matron Mother is holding her snake headed whip, Jynx in front of her, and
				Hyde recoiling in fear behind Jynx. The Matron Mother stops what she was doing and subtly threatening
				the group to leave the three of them be. Stain begins speaking in undercommon that he would like to
				oversee it as a bit of their culture.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The Matron is surprised by his ability to speak undercommon begins to ask where
				he learned it. Perhaps he was ordered to marry as part of the cultural exchange. He says that he was
				ordered to go down there but not as a cultural exchange and shows a scar from one of the drow’s
				signature whips on his shoulder. She asks which family he was involved with to which he starts naming
				off the houses he eliminated in his years trapped in the underdark.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">She says he doesn’t look nearly old enough to have known of those houses. He
				responds with “Well I might not look it but you certainly look old enough to have experienced those
				years when I was trapped down there trying to escape so you likely know what I was capable of back then.
				See that was my first time experiencing true power. Down there in the dark I got my first taste. Now
				back then I was only fighting for myself and a way out. Now if need be, I will fight for my friends
				Hyde, Jynx, and Calida. If you ever put so much as a cut or bruise on them, I will go back down there
				and none of your houses will be spared... Now it has been quite a few years, House Tenebrae was right
				next to the late House T’syr correct?... Your people couldn’t stop me then. They certainly can’t stop me
				now that the last of my limits are gone.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The Matron is clearly off-put by this.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida tries to break the tension by suggesting they all sit and have some tea,
				dragging Ignacio and Serena to the kitchen. Serena makes the tea while Calida has a panic attack.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Eventually they all gather and have a nice long talk.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius gets unparalyzed and furious that he’s trapped in the back of the inn
				by the drow guards. He ends up pacing around the room that Magnus and Caminus are in all three bouncing
				ideas around on how to get out. - in the end they just suck it up and wait.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Eventually the Matron leaves and Jynx, Calida, and Hyde all get to stay.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cass, Caminus, and Magnus join the others and upon seeing that Hyde, Jynx, and
				Calida are all safe Cass sits down to start tending to his shoulder. Hyde comes to help him, he
				apologizes to her for not being able to do anything.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Everyone is exhausted from this encounter and head to bed shortly thereafter
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Jynx clings to Cassius and ends up sharing a bed with him for the night after
				he strips and washes her bedding so his blood isn't on it anymore.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Ignacio and Calida talk about getting married.</p>

			<h3>Wedding</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Double wedding with Honerva and Fulvia as well as Calida and Ignacio</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">It’s a wonderful party - Serena’s mom threatens to castrate Stain, Ignacio’s
				brothers are antagonizing each other and Stain...</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius and Serena are commandeered at the beginning of the ceremony for some
				unknown purpose - until the end of the ceremony when the two hand both couples their weapons and the
				whole party turns into a free-for-all</p>

			<h3>Wedding</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Spiros takes the group to the town with two towers. On the way, everyone is
				kind of tense since their last experience with trains didn't go so well but there is a royal guard in
				the passenger car so everyone relaxes a bit.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">There are a couple of strange people who Serena and Cassius end up sitting
				with. They claim to be a young married couple on their honeymoon, the woman appearing to be pregnant.
				Serena can't shake the feeling that there is something wrong with their story but she can't quite put
				her finger on it.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">There’s a strange guy in the corner with a ton of baggage, and other people
				here and there throughout the train.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Everything is fine for the most part. The woman at one point looks ill and goes
				to the dining car to try and recuperate. Seeing that her ‘husband’ isn't going to accompany her Cassius
				offers to escort her since he’s concerned for her health, leaving his journal behind.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena takes this moment to write in his journal that the couple is super
				sketchy and the girl had definitely lied about her story. She makes a joking comment about drawing
				things in his journal to ease any suspicion but the husband comes to sit next to her wanting to see.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">So Serena silently apologizes and graffitis on the book...</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius is a bit peeved when he returns but sees the message and is put on
				alert. He decides to take a potion of detect thoughts to see if he can glean anything. Unfortunately it
				is an area of effect spell and he ends up getting bombarded by the surface thoughts of everyone in front
				of him.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena is thinking about Stain and Cassius is scarred forever by the sight</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva is thinking of Fulvia</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Magnus of food</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Someone on the far end of the car has the thought: ‘When one of them goes to
				the bathroom, that’s when we’ll do it’</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Startled, Cassius tries to figure out who it is that had that thought but can't
				catch it. Desma notices his behavior and moves so Cassius can sit with her, Stain, and Ignacio. He
				explains what he heard and everyone is on alert.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida also hears this conversation and it becomes a race to figure out who it
				is before something happens.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">They fail. One of the guards goes to the restroom and there is a gunshot from
				that end of the car. A small group of thieves tells everyone to stay in their seats and remain calm. One
				has a hostage and Stain signs for everyone to stay put. Unfortunately not everyone understands DSL.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The thieves are after something in the strange guy’s luggage.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Caminus starts a fight and the ‘couple’ that Serena was sitting with fidget. A
				loud gunshot rings out and Serena sees a gun that had been hidden under the woman’s dress.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The ring leader goes down, releasing the hostage and all hell breaks loose.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cass grabs the hostage (who has now fainted) and stays with the strange man and
				her while everyone else beats the crap out or the thieves.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The couple and the strange guy run for it, along with whatever the thieves were
				after</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Desma recognizes her as her ex - Magnus witnesses that awkward exchange</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">By the time they get to the town everyone has sworn their hatred of trains and
				their collective refusal to ever use them again.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena takes Cassius’ book back and tries to draw something better, not
				satisfied with her previous rushed attempt.</p>

			<h3>Tower of War</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">They arrive at the town and can see both towers - one is a deep red, the other
				is gold.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The group heads towards the red tower lead by Spiros but find that Desma can't
				enter the tower. The rest file in but Stain pulls Serena aside and tells her he’s going to the gold
				tower alone.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">After a bit of persuading she finally agrees to go with the others but before
				she goes he gives her his mother’s pen.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">They enter a large, seemingly endless forest. There is evidence of someone else
				passing through recently and they follow the signs to a corpse.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">There are giant monster cat things with strange pulsing red goop on them.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena separates from the group to go scout and runs into a huge one. She
				slowly backs towards the group while simultaneously attempting to talk to it. Cue fighting.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">There is a staircase that spirals down from the ceiling and everyone files up
				to the next floor. A grate is over a pit of the goop, upon walking over it the goop rises up but doesn't
				touch. The goop makes enemies appear and anyone touched by it begins attacking their allies. Cass falls
				victim to it and bombs those that are still trapped in the staircase. - Luckily he doesn't deal much
				damage. It is extremely inconvenient though, and Magnus and Honerva team up to try and incapacitate him.
				Eventually Magnus manages to throw him down the stairs which knocks him out.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Eventually we get it together and manage to get to the next floor after going
				back down and resting.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The next floor is a bedroom, finding nothing there they try the doors one of
				which leads out to an inn. There is a war going on outside between goop infected NPCs and normal NPCs.
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius has the idea to try to fight their way towards the city center and aim
				for the grandest building assuming it is the capital building.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">They use Ignacio to scout ahead and relay information back to them to determine
				the correct route. Upon arriving at the building they find it blockaded with a small skirmish going on.
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cass throws a void bomb and everyone manages to squeeze past and into the
				building while the NPCs are distracted. Calida and Caminus stay behind to keep an eye on the battle and
				make sure they won't all be trapped.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">There is a huge vault that they decide to explore - trying to figure out what
				to do from here. Once they’re all in there Spiros begins to shut them inside going on a monologue while
				beginning to change, growing into a giant monster and proving himself a traitor more interested in
				creating super soldiers.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">A voice behind him calls his attention and Spiros turns to face Ares. The two
				fight with the group peppering Spiros with attacks from behind which don't seem to do much. When Spiros
				finally falls his body melts into that red goop and covers the floor of the vault.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Everyone climbs on top of crates and barrels attempting to keep out of it.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Ares wants a challenge and decides to fight everyone. Anyone who touches to
				goop gets a penalty to their mental stats but a boost to their strength. Magnus uses this to his
				advantage while Serena shoots from farther back and Cass and Ignacio try to keep from falling in.
				Honerva activates an ability that gives her wings of fire and she is able to hover harmlessly above the
				floor.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">They deal little to no damage and a single hit from Ares takes over half health
				for most of the group.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Magnus finally can't handle the mental loss anymore and become a vegetable, and
				everyone is hurt. The situation looks hopeless. Cassius begins coordinating, hands Serena a potion of
				true shot while forcing a potion down magnus’ throat to fix the mental damage so he retains the strength
				boost. He yells for Honerva to flank with Serena so her next shot is practically guaranteed to hit and
				be a sneak attack.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">It works and they deal a massive blow to Ares but it isn't enough to even phase
				the God.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Finally, Serena pulls out Stain’s pen in desperation, about to try and summon
				him when suddenly Ares stops.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">They learn that he was once in love with Stain’s mother and wishes to give her
				son a gift. Ares gives Serena his axe - wrapped securely to keep her from harm. He explains its uses,
				its flaws, warns that it may drive its wielder crazy.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">She accepts it and the group leaves the tower.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The tower shrinks down to a crystal which can be placed in the axe.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Desma greets them looking hagarred, handing Cassius a letter and saying she is
				sorry before hearing their report.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius tucks the letter away for later as Desma tells them that Stain has yet
				to return.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Desma takes the majority of the group back to the capital leaving Cassius with
				Serena to wait for Stain.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva and Magnus decide to take leaves of absence to collect themselves after
				being forced to attack their friends.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius manages to keep Serena calm, and away from the door that is way too hot
				and would kill her if it opened. Despite her desperate need to be even a little closer to where Stain
				is.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">They feel the ground shake and they hide to watch a giant creature appear from
				a rift in space. It sifts around where the red tower used to be muttering about being ‘too late again’
				before beating on the still sealed tower for a moment. Having no success it trudges off.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Safe again Cass and Serena return to their vigil until...</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">[We now enter into something that was actually written down]</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">You wait outside the tower, worry a live and squirming viper in your stomach,
				squeezing against your heart. The inability to breathe past your fear for the man still inside is
				suffocating. Heavy clouds roll across the horizon as the sun begins to set, the signs of a storm forcing
				you to take action. </p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">You begin hurridly fastening down your tent, hammering down several pittons
				with efficient expertise. It is as you drive the last into the earth that you feel a tremor beneith your
				knees. The echoes of the earth's shudder transfer to you through the metal still against your hand. Your
				attention is then caught by the tower as it inexplicitly begins to shrink.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">You throw aside your tools, running to the tower door as the structure
				continues to grow smaller.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The door still has yet to open.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">It isn't until the tower is almost half its original size that the door is
				thrown ajar, blinding you as golden light pours from the interior. You refuse to look away.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Your vision returns to you and you see not one, but two, figures emerging from
				the radiance; one being carried in the other's arms. By then the doorway has all but disappeared, the
				light fading until you can clearly see a man dropping to his knees, Stain cradled in his arms.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">"STAIN!" You barely register the single word that has burst from your lungs as
				you run to them.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Heat rolls off of the stranger, a faint white light pulsing within his core.
				The burning sensation, soothed before it can become unbearable by the winds that are now tearing across
				the area. As you stand before them, his eyes rise to meet yours.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Tears stream down the man's face, evaporating on his cheeks and you can see
				smoldering specks of ember upon his skin that fade to black as they expand. He looks upon you with a
				wistful smile.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">"Your beauty and tales once again bring me low, Mnemosyne..." His form begins
				to crumble as the name leaves his lips on a sigh, leaving behind only a pile of ash. Stain sinks into
				the remains of the man's embrace, unresponsive as the sun drops below the clouds, painting them a
				brilliant, fiery red as the first drops of rain begin to fall.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">He is still clothed by strips of fabric, and his fists remain wrapped in
				leather, likely in an attempt to protect himself from the heat but he does not respond to your touch as
				you gather him into your arms. You bring him into the safety of your tent and the relative comfort of a
				warm bed, intent on treating what wounds he may have sustained.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">You pull off his coverings and are met with the sight of a burn mark, livid and
				red against his chest. It seems partially healed over, no longer life-threatening but clearly once so.
				You dress his wounds, treating him to the best of your ability but it is six days before he wakes.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">When he at last regains consciousness, he is groggy and confused. "How... how
				did you get me out?" Even as he asks he is shaking his head. "Open the book, flip through the last
				pages. I'll tell you when to stop."</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Though you'd rather do nothing but revel in his return to you, you do as he
				asks and open the book. The last page is still the one which he'd had you tear out. He never used it.
				You begin paging backwards through the book until Stain bids you to stop. </p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The passage that meets your gaze is as follows: </p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The challenger gropes his way up the stairs, his eyes rendered useless by the
				light within the god's domain. The archer watches with interest, impressed that anyone has manages to
				make it this far. However, he can't just allow any mere upstart to receive his blessing without more of
				a challenge.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">It is not the most sporting, the archer admits to himself, seeing as his target
				is blind. Though, if he is truly deserving then perhaps he will dodge. With that thought, the archer
				pulls back his bow and lets fly a burning arrow. It does not err, striking his target in the chest. The
				outcome was expected, seeing as how it was he who invented the sport, but still the archer finds himself
				disappointed that it is over so soon. He'd been expecting... a little more.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">He makes his way to the prone figure, his arrow still sizzling where it lay
				buried in the man's flesh. The archer examines the metal box upon the man's back and unceremoniously
				pulls it from its place and forces it open. He'd been merely curious as to its contents but finds
				himself surprised as he is met with empty inkwells.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">He moves them aside, rummaging through a sheaf of papers; bank notes form the
				Patrian government. Many of them, all for exorbitant amounts.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The god laughs "If only I had the power still to return to that plane. I would
				be rich." He tosses them aside and looks for the next item to catch his eye. A small box is the next to
				meet his hand. He opens it, finding what is clearly a wedding band adorned with a small diamond.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">"Wow, there must be more inflation than I expected! Guess these aren't worth as
				much as I thought." He grins at the fallen man beside him, not expecting a response and not receiving
				one either. "If that is what you had planned, does that mean this book is filled with poems for your
				beloved?" He closes the box and returns it to its place as he lifts a maroon colored book from its
				place.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">"I've never seen a book this size, no wonder the inkwells are dry, you were
				writing it yourself. If these are any good, I just might have to bring you back to write more for me."
				He laughs as the unwitting offer falls upon deaf ears.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">In his current state such a thing may be possible for a human but not for the
				being next to him. The power required would be too great. He opens the book, still chuckling to himself
				until his eyes fall upon the page.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The smile falls from his lips, his fingers trembling as they trace the sweetly
				familiar lines of elegant script. "This... can't be..." He feels his mind being pulled towards memories
				so ethereal and fond that he'd forced himself not to think about during his time in this self-made
				prison. He gives into them now as his hand sweeps across the page, as though through that touch he could
				feel the woman he'd once loved.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">He found himself back in his chariot, blazing across the sky as he spied a
				beautiful woman sitting below in a folding chair. There was a book in her lap, another in her off hand,
				and a pen in her main. Her amber hair shone like gold in his light. Never once did she look up at him,
				her eyes trained upon her books. It gave her a coy demeanor.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">She did not seem to notice him in his travels but he always noticed her. Day
				after day he would look for her, never finder her in the same place but always perched in her chair and
				always with her books.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">He became entranced by this woman. Each day trying to get closer to her, and
				each day finding himself attempting to glean her secrets from what he could see from his high perch. He
				felt himself drawn to her, but could not understand why. Finally, he could bear the distance no longer
				and he stopped his chariot at a nearby hill so that he may greet her.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Strangely enough, she was not fazed by his introduction. The appearance of the
				God Apollo did not seem to surprise her at all She had been aware of his presence but it seemed she
				dutifully kept to her work, documenting battles that had occurred at the sites where she was visiting.
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Apollo didn’t know it then, but he'd been drawn to one of the few remaining
				Titans in the world. Honored and revered by kings and poets alike, the Goddess Mnemosyne. Mother to the
				nine muses whom Apollo lead in chorus. Later, a tenth whom would never have the chance to be fathered.
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The two spent many days together that summer, Apollo sharing his songs and
				poetry, Mnemosyne great tales of love and war. Their love blossomed and they began to share even more of
				their time. As long as summer was, however, it was not without end.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">A vibrant cloud swept from the North East blanketing the land and out right
				killing the magical beings in its path, or at least sapping their power until they passed from
				exhaustion. Apollo and his kin secluded themselves in pocket dimensions at the urging of Athena. Titans
				like Mnemosyne, however, were not worshipped the same way and so did not have the power to access such a
				safe haven. So, they had been separated and Apollo was sure he would never come to see her again.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Apollo shakes himself out of his memories with a start, flipping to the back of
				the book and seeing the words as they are written. With a growing sense of horror he realizes his
				mistake as he looks down at man next to him. Realizing who he is. He could heal the wound he'd
				inflicted, it was well within his power to do that much. Restoring life, though, is much more difficult.
				Especially attempting to bring back someone who may be a full god just as he himself is.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">He knows he has to try. This is the son of his beloved. Possibly his own. He
				spends as much of his power as he dares to treat the wound, knowing full well that if he lacks the
				energy for the latter half then both of their lives would be forfeit.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">...As the god fades, so too does his tower. Each step he feels his life
				draining. Just a little more. Just a step more. He only cares for his passenger, and as his feet cross
				the rapidly shrinking threshold he falls to his knees. He no longer has the strength to walk. His
				precious cargo lies limp against him as he breathes the air of the mortal plane.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">"STAIN!" A woman's scream forces him to raise his head.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">He searches for the sun, the glory and warmth that he'd been left without for a
				decade. Instead he is met by the silhouette of a woman. Her golden hair lit by the red light of the
				setting sun, appearing as a brilliant amber glow around her.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Tears that he did not know he could still shed fall upon his cooling cheeks.
				"Your beauty and tales once again bring me low, Mnemosyne..." His power is gone, his light fading with
				his last breath. He is thankful. For the preserved life in his arms, and the final glimpse of a love
				long thought lost.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">[so ends our prewritten section and flowery language]</p>

			<h3>The Dumb leading the Blind</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Once everything is settled and he is no longer directly needed Cassius sits to
				read the letter that Desma gave him. His family had fallen victim to the murderer, he was cut from their
				will and so all assets went to his younger brother, Hadrian. Being an infant, Hadrian was sent to live
				with his closest living relatives - the drow.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius panics grabbing Calida and demanding to know what the drow do to
				infants who were not their own, male and not drow. She calms him down saying that they wouldn't harm him
				as a baby. Just probably neglect him.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena takes Stain outside, when he stands in the sun he can see but he becomes
				a heat source, burning everything around him. Serena has to be dragged away before she gets hurt.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Eventually everyone settles down to talk about everything. They collectively
				decide to go rescue Cassius’ brother (despite Cass trying to say it wasn't worth the risk) and begin
				making preparations for that. - they cut off all his hair and Serena gives him a hooded scarf, which he
				then wears ALWAYS.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Jynx takes a casting of Cassius’ head and sends it along with Calida’s donated
				hair to a wigmaker that Serena knows in the Capital.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva and Magnus return during this time period.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain proposes to Serena so he can take her with them into the underdark - they
				will be going as a diplomatic party. Serena, Stain, Calida, and Cassius. Everyone else will stay in the
				capital during this time.</p>

			<h3>Jynx - the Rat King</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The party splits (cause that’s always a good idea), Stain, Serena, Calida, and
				Cassius head off to the underdark while Caminus, Magnus, Honerva, and the rest of the group stay in the
				capital.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Caminus, Magnus, and Honerva go to see what Hyde and Jynx have been doing and
				decide to help Jynx get some materials.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">While working in the capital with Hyde, Jynx had been experimenting with the
				lacrima crystals and shrinking spells. She had at some point made "friends" with the rats that were in
				the lab. The plan is to shrink everyone down, make their way through the rat tunnels, shrink down the
				metal, and steal some more lacrima to replenish Jynx's dwinding supply.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Everything is going pretty well till right after they get the metal shrunken
				down and put on a tiny cart. The sounds of a large rat making it's way through the tunnels is heard and
				Jynx is a worried voice says "Biteram... We need to move quickly!" The group begins running as fast as
				their itty bitty legs will carry them. Caminus falls down and gets thrown on top of the cart of
				materials. They just barely make it out of the wall before Biteram catches up to them but Jynx dispels
				the magic and they return to their normal size and she shoos the rat away.</p>

			<h3>Base Baby</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The diplomatic group gets to the underdark without too much of a problem, they
				are informed that they will be able to meet with the head of the ___ house the following day.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">They do some shopping. Cassius buys two bolts of Spider Silk to send to
				Tarquin.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">When they do meet the matron mother, the matron of house Tenebre is also there.
				The two are clearly scheming but everyone maintains a professional calm. At the end of a lengthy debate
				the drow give up the child but keep hold of the assets requiring monthly reports of who is with him and
				how he is doing.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The drow now have the assumption that Serena is Stain’s wife and Stain is
				Cassius’... patron? There was a vague connotation that no one bothered to dispute and it ended up
				working in their favor.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena who understands everything thanks to a Comprehend Language potion from
				Cass clearly hears their plan to use these reports to keep tabs on Stain. Knowing that they won't have
				any kind of privacy until they are back on the surface, she keeps this to herself.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cass spends the rest of the day making wooden toys to keep the baby
				entertained, he is surprised to find that he is protective of him and is always nearby even when Calida
				or Serena are holding him. Stain looks almost sad.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">They have him sit and arrange the baby with him so Stain can hold the child.
				This seems to make him happy.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">They manage to return to the surface and get back to their usual inn without
				any further incident.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Rejoining the main group everyone is excited to have a ‘base baby’</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius finally pauses to talk to Hyde and offers to let her hold Hadrian. She
				is perturbed by the fragile squishy thing. She quickly hands him back. She does admit that she missed
				having Cass around. Later she gives Cassius a baby carrier - its a large metal ball with a dynamo effect
				so the child inside won't be harmed no matter what. Hadrian now has a small collection of wooden toys
				made by Cass.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The following day Cassius and Magnus drag Desma and Calida with them to go hire
				a nanny. Desma also informs everyone that they have their next mission assignment and are set to leave
				in about two weeks time.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena and Stain go to Serena’s parents to announce their engagement... yeah
				her mums not pleased.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">That evening as everyone is settling down Stain is hearing voices. Serena tries
				to help him find them until they have almost everyone involved in a trial and error - come to find that
				Stain can now hear prayers or anything that is directed at him.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">[several days later]</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cass is in the common room with Hadrian and Desma</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Caminus is working with Jynx n Hyde</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva is with Fulvia</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena has stuff to do</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">An older lady walks into the inn and begins looking around before spotting
				Cassius and Desma sitting with Hadrian. She beelines towards them and introduces herself as Helen, the
				new nurse. Cassius clumsily introduces himself and Hadrian and belatedly introduces Desma as well.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Luckily she is fine with excessive travelling and after exchanging pleasantries
				she asks Cass about their upbringing. Cassius slowly answers but ends up incriminating himself since he
				wasn't expecting the question and to him his upbringing was normal. Desma informs him it was not and she
				gives a briefer summary of his rearing simply put: noble household. Distant parents.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Helen declares that she will be ending that cycle. She also informs Desma that
				she requires a room to herself and no weapons will be allowed to enter said room. She also asks that she
				receive warning of any upcoming danger.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Desma agrees to these terms though she admits that she may not be able to tell
				her everything if it involves military secrets. They come to an agreement and Helen checks into the inn
				and drops off her luggage.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The rest of the day she hovers near Cassius monitoring his actions, correcting
				him occasionally, letting Hadrian get used to her, and making casual small talk.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva goes to shower after trying to run Jynx’s mechanical horse/tank in some
				poor farmer’s field. Driving is hard for the blind. Poor cabbages. Now everything is covered in manure.
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Caminus is working with Hyde, talking about modifications for the armor</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Jynx walks in reeking of manure. Throws whatever she was carrying into her
				corner</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Hyde tells Jynx to just prestidigitation the smell - manure is now smelling
				like mushrooms</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cam demands to know what the thing is that she threw in was.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Jynx made a mechanical horse. Since Cam and Hyde were working on armor.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">She dispels the shrink spell and the contraption grows to full size... inside
				the workroom. It knocks over a shelf and pushes a work table into the wall.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Typical Jynxy conversation ensues. Caminus suggests she takes the horse
				outside. Honerva arrives at that point, having bathed and wearing ill-fitting, borrowed clothes</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">At that moment, Jynx takes Cam’s advice and shrinks herself in the horse and
				walks the small mech out of the workshop, in time to see the horse, now kitten-sized, being piloted by a
				similarly-miniature Jynx.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Following mini-Jynx and horse outside, Honerva watches Jynx chase a civilian
				with it, nearly being stepped on before returning to normal size.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva takes flight as Jynx starts to outrun her, successfully landing on top.
				Realizing she won’t be able to continue pulling the levers for much longer, Honerva leads Jynx out of
				town where the horse tumbles to a stop. Finding themselves relatively unscathed, the two head back to
				the workshop.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">In the same pre-tower timespan, Serena heads to her tailor friend in town,
				Nils. She orders a dress, as seen here. Nils starts brainstorming and embellishing the design. Serena
				tells them that she will likely be gone for a few months. They say that won’t be a problem, with a price
				to follow upon completion. She also requests a dress for a baby, and Nils shows her a few very fancy
				“layer-cake”-like dresses. They start with the fanciest one, and Serena pulls out the 150 gp to buy it
				on the spot.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Returning to the base, Serena entreats upon Cass to “play with” the baby,
				saying that she bought him a gift. Taking the baby to the common room, she attempts to dress up the baby
				in the new dress, only to be unpleasantly surprised to find he needs to be changed. Cassius, pulling out
				a diaper bag, shows Serena how to change a diaper. Helen also oversees the process. After being changed,
				Serena dresses Hadrian up in the new dress.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Entering the workshop, Calida finds a dazed Caminus and the mess created by the
				previous activities. Accustomed to cleaning up after Jynx, Calida begins tidying the workshop. After a
				few minutes, Kali enters and talks to Caminus, asking what happened over in the corner where Calida is
				sweeping. Caminus tells her that Jynx was attempting to make a mechanical beast of burden but had the
				bad idea to start it indoors. Kali, dismayed, asks if Jynx is damaging the workshop that Kali’s renting
				to us… while Kali is in turn renting it from someone else. Gesturing and jangling his coin purse,
				Caminus attempts to use his silver tongue to get out of trouble. Kali seems unimpressed. Thinking
				quickly, Caminus evaluates the structural damage to the building, suggesting a replacement of the
				damaged beam. This goes over poorly. Kali gives Caminus an ultimatum: fix the beam perfectly, or she’ll
				break the rocks apparently filling Caminus’s head. Seeing his response, she clangs her hammer against a
				shield, deafeningly close to Caminus. Instead, she entrusts the task to Hyde before storming out.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Around half an hour later, Honerva and Jynx return to the workshop. Out of
				sympathy (for Kali) /pity (for Caminus), Honevera offers to fix the beam with Mending and does so.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius pens a letter to the matron mother detailing the trip back to the
				surface and the hiring of the nurse; Stain is given charge of official correspondence.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Everyone gets onto the train, heading East. Jynx complains to Caminus that the
				trip is boring. Focusing for ten minutes on Magnus… nothing happens. Dismayed, she turns to Caminus
				instead… who gets the uncontrollable urge to dance around like a monkey. Another passenger claps,
				although Caminus’s monkey dance is just… alright.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The group arrives in the small fishing town with the sea-foam colored tower.
				Safely. Despite the train’s best efforts. (As a machine its efforts were minimal and we arrive
				unscathed) [Did I mention we hate trains?]</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Carina Navigium is our contact for the mission, a gnomish woman who was once a
				quite passionate soldier [[used to [do stuff for the military]]] but she’s spent her post-military
				career as a writer. Arriving at her house, we notice her lawn is poorly kept; her flower-boxes empty.
				Knocking on the door, she answers, and it is noticed that her furniture is gone. She tells us that the
				tower she went in was very fancy, but very boring. She didn’t meet anyone inside. She says she was in
				there for about a week, but it felt like longer… and was a lot longer on the outside. Apparently she was
				thought dead, and her house pilfered. She thought the tower would be good writing inspiration, but was
				infuriated to find it wasn’t. The inside of the tower seems to be residential; a home, though she isn’t
				sure whose. When asked for advice, she instead offers an alternative: employment. Desma accepts. Carina
				also tells us that she was able to leave the tower. While the door was locked, it was not hidden as in
				previous towers. She finally found the mechanism to unlock it: moving a bust just right. She grabs a
				backpack containing what we surmise is most of her possessions and heads towards town.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Heading to the local tavern, Honerva and Calida lead to find out if there have
				been any changes in the townsfolk since the tower appeared. Meeting a woman in the tavern, she tells
				them that her boyfriend, a jerk, left her right after the tower, for one of the farmer’s daughters. This
				is the key to unraveling the entire tower mystery, right here. For the next hour, she gossips about
				everyone in the town, enrapturing Honerva. This is such a dramatic town.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Pulling Stain aside, Serena mentions that Desma is using her whip to talk to
				Athena… so is it possible for Stain to talk to Ares through the axe? Stain says yes, absolutely, with
				his typical enthusiasm. He holds out his hands, with Serena giving him the axe, still wrapped. He starts
				to talk to it, telling it that he’s Menemose’s son. No response. The two of them head off to find Desma.
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">She tells them that she holds the whip and concentrates her thoughts towards
				it. Dismayed, Serena confirms that this means Stain has to touch the axe.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The next day, before we all head into the tower, Serena gives Stain a kiss and
				makes him promise not to use the axe.</p>

			<h3>The Next Tower</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The door opens and we (Caminus, Serena, Cassius, Calida, Honvera, Magnus, Jynx,
				Hyde, Ignacio, and Carina) all step inside to find carpet. The room visible is lavish, with
				peach-colored marble floors, plush maroon carpet, plush benches, intricately-carved statues, and a
				bubbling fountain in the middle. The walls are decorated with beautiful paper and intricate moulding,
				which almost seem to move with how lifelike the images of cherubs in clouds are. Carina walks around the
				room, pointing out the bust that she used to open the door, directing us to the stairs.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida heads towards a staircase, stopping about four feet in front of it,
				mentally unable to continue. The same effect affects everyone. Carina directs us to drink from the
				fountain, which Serena and Honerva do. It tastes like perfectly pure, cool water. Serena attempts to
				walk up the stairs after having drank the water, to no avail. Honerva casts Detect Magic and determines
				that the spell on the water is of Conjuration.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honvera tries to take a running jump toward the stairs, but just before she
				jumps she stops herself and she falls over instead.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Other than the stairs, the other exits to the room are two hallways, one on
				either side, and two doors, just north of the hallways. Calida suggests always taking the right-hand
				path. Carina tells us there are 18 rooms. Ignacio is looking around at things (though he’s technically
				in charge), while Jynx knocks over a statue. It falls, breaks… and just lays there. Carina says she left
				the last time by burning everything she could find… clearly it didn’t have any effect.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Carina leads us onwards, clockwise, through the hallway in the west. Through
				there, immediately, is the dining room. There is food laid out, and Calida asks if it was edible. The
				food all appears to be fresh and hot. Caminus goes for a turkey leg while Calida goes for some wine.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">She comments that the wine is earthy, with notes of wood and amber. Carina says
				that for her it tastes dry, which pairs well with the available cheese. It all tasted different based on
				what each person likes.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Continuing westward from the dining room, a fully stocked kitchen with
				partially prepared meals, and cooking tools everywhere. It looks as though the kitchen was left while it
				was in use, as if everyone put down their tools and left. A small storeroom sits on the north wall of
				the kitchen, with another room to the northwest. The northwest room is a pantry, with crates and
				barrels, and a set of upward-leading stairs at the far end of it.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Jynx asks for Magnus’s and Caminus’s help: she would like Magnus to throw
				Caminus up the stairs. Both agreeing, they attempt it. Magnus picks up Caminus and just as he’s about to
				release to throw, he cannot release and they both collapse in a heap. Honvera attempts to walk on her
				hands up the stairs. Serena asks nicely, to no avail.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Caminus suggests to Magnus that they should steal a barrel of what is presumed
				to be wine, and Magnus does so. He looks back to realize that the barrel has replenished itself. Looking
				back at the food and the wine, it seems to replenish itself whenever it isn’t being watched.
				Specifically, though, the containers of food themselves are replenished, rather than being refilled if
				removed.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida hypothesizes that Dionysus might be the owner of the tower, based upon
				it being a perfect party atmosphere.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">North from the dining room is a sitting room, with a piano, a cello, and a
				harp. Honerva attempts to play, and does so. It feels like a high-quality instrument, but doesn’t seem
				to be magically imbued with any sort of performance enhancement. Carina says that on the hour, music
				will play from the instruments, but only if no one is in the room.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Continuing east from the sitting room is a small bathroom, as well as a series
				of bedrooms, eight in total. Four on the north side of the hallway, four on the south side. They all
				appear to be identical. Calida bounces on one of the beds, finding it almost impossibly soft and
				springy. Everyone piles on the ye olde memory foam bed. Past the bedrooms, to the west, is a study.
				Calida and Serena pull books, finding romance novels. On another shelf, adventure books. Serena studies
				the desk, hoping for personalized stationery, finding none.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Continuing south, we find a library, containing labeled bookshelves. Honevera
				backtracks and leaves a note on the desk in the study explaining our wish to meet the master of the
				tower, then when we leave, the note is gone. We make our way back around to the main room - the statue
				Jynx broke is indeed fixed.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The team splits up to test different things. Caminus and Magnus go to get
				shitfaced, to see if they can get up the stairs while blackout drunk. Jynx suggests that to drink a lot,
				Caminus must be bigger. She casts a spell on him that ends up making him 20 feet tall (he lays down to
				avoid bumping into the ceiling). After downing two barrels, Honerva suggests that he wait until the
				alcohol hits him. Hit him it does, getting him blackout drunk in a matter of minutes. He hugs the other
				three (at the same time), telling them how much he appreciates their companionship. After Caminus says
				that he loves his companions, Jynx thinks that his love is unrequited, so casts Reckless Infatuation on
				Honerva. She now wants Sempai to notice her.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Magnus and Caminus notice that Carina is watching them and Cam tries to hug her
				too but she steps away. Carina is enamored with the forbidden love story she has discovered.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">After a few minutes of amusement, Jynx dispels the Enlarge Person, leaving
				Caminus with an upset stomach.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena, Cassius, and Hyde search the library for clues, coming up with more
				than a few books that are blank. One they do find with words is a book similar to How to Win Friends and
				Influence People. Coming up empty-handed, they agree that having a party is probably the next best idea.
				Hyde notices Serena looking forlorn, and says that Stain can handle the time difference more than anyone
				else, considering he has more time to compare it to. That settled, they head to debauchery.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena strips down and gets into the fountain, then has a realization. She gets
				out, heads to the dining room to alert the others and grab alcohol, then heads back. Carina has a glint
				in her eye. From the other room, we hear a chime from the harp, sounding once.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Hyde joins Serena in the fountain and ‘convinces’ - orders - Cassius to join
				them.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Everyone but Magnus and possibly others convene in the main hall to get drunk.
				Jynx goes to find Caminus, but finds him immobile from inebriation. She shrinks him and his barf barrel.
				Things get a bit crazy. Serena eventually questions Carina about what kind of writer she is.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Carina become extremely animated as she talks about her writing and the books
				that she’s written.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">As the splash war gets worse, Cassius and Hyde leave the fountain and Hyde
				takes Cass off to another room.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Carina continues talking about her romance novels, asking about which
				“pairings” are “canon” in the group. She mentions Honerva and Caminus, which causes Serena to be
				confused. Getting out of the fountain, she attempts to take Honerva to another room, but she doesn’t
				want to go without tiny barrel Caminus. After some negotiating, she takes her into the other room, and
				asks her what’s going on, why she’s so enamored with Caminus. Magnus mentions that Jynx waved her hands
				and did some weird things while they were in the pantry. Honerva puts two and two together and snaps out
				of the spell, feeling gross and slimy at her unwanted feelings.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">She storms back into the fountain room, picking up Jynx and trying to make her
				understand why that wasn't okay to do. Jynx doesn’t understand. Honerva storms off, while Serena tries
				to explain to Jynx. Jynx mentions “the baby said it would be funny”, which Serena questions.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Jynx complains that “her jokes aren’t funny up here” (as in, on the Surface).
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Jynx decides to make a locket for Honerva as an apology and spends a long while
				sketching various plans for the piece. However, there is no forge so she is disappointed that she can't
				actually make it for her yet.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">About an hour later, Jynx knocks on the door to apologize. Honerva says that it
				wasn’t so much that Jynx betrayed Honerva’s trust, it was that now she feels like she has to talk to
				Fulvia because she betrayed /her/ trust. Controlling her heart/mind was a more personal violation than
				controlling her body. Jynx doesn’t seem to get it, and mentions the baby again. Honerva attempts to look
				on the wall where Jynx says it is, but she doesn’t see it. Jynx rips out and gives Honerva a piece of
				paper, with a spell (Reckless Infatuation) on it. Giving up the spell from her spellbook is a concrete
				promise to never cast it again.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Meanwhile, Serena goes off in search of Ignacio. She finds Calida in flagrante
				delicto with Ignacio, and tells them about the chubby baby. Shortly thereafter Honerva and Jynx arrive
				and say the same thing: Jynx has been seeing a talking baby in the walls.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida notices that both established couples immediately lost inhibitions and
				went off to be intimate in private and, after Ignacio uses Detect Magic to find “something” in the room
				with him and Calida, Honerva decides to go check the room of the other amorous couple.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">HYDE CONFESSED HER LOVE!! AND CAS DID HIS AWKWARD BEST TO RETURN THE SENTIMENT!
				(but was it true...dun dun dun!) Hyde runs out naked waving her gun. She and Cas were hearing voices
				too. Honerva explains the shadow baby badly. Carina was peeping on everyone. Ignacio actually got mad
				when faced with the mixture of magically influenced feelings and peeping near strangers. Eros appears
				first as a shadow baby then as a grown man with blond hair. We showed that we have a good grasp on love
				so we passed the test. We have to make ourselves presentable in the changing rooms in the lower level
				then we get to meet the mistress of the tower.</p>

			<h3>Insert Clever Section Title Here</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva: a blue dress (link). A couple bracelets, one of those upper arm
				thingies and a flower. She gets some color-coordination help from Serena.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida: soft and slinky, with drapes at the neck and a very muted pattern to
				the fabric in a royal blue shade. She gets a little help with her makeup from</p>

				Jynx requests (from Serena) electric yellow eyeshadow, with which Serena suggests a pop of green at the
				tips. Instead of wings, Jynx requests lightning bolts.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Caminus: An art-deco-inspired pure white toga, with a red cloak with gold and
				black patterns. He wears his symbol of Hephaestus as a necklace.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Magnus: Takes off his armor, finds fresher, newer versions of what he’s already
				wearing, gives his armor a bit of clean and polish, and puts everything back on.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Carina: a scarf made out of beaded pearls. She also puts on a big floppy hat
				and a seafoam-green blouse. Serena offers makeup help to her as well; she accepts. She requests a
				nautical theme, which Serena obliges.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">We all line up where Eros is waiting. Calida mentions to Serena that if Stain
				were here, he’d probably be better off wearing nothing than his usual fashion sense. Honerva asks Eros
				what it was that finally caused his presence. He says, “much like a curse, an act of true love”.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Heading up the stairs, we find ourselves on a beach, where we see a woman on a
				lounge chair, a few feet in front of us. Eros tells us we must go one at a time. Serena volunteers, then
				decides to give Carina an opportunity, which she takes. She approaches the woman, who waves her hand and
				a chair appears.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena goes next, and Carina applauds. Aphrodite lifts an eyebrow. “Nice
				presentation, but I don’t suppose you’ve walked much on sand.” Serena says she hasn’t, and curtseys.
				Aphrodite summons another chair.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Ignacio does his best attempt at a formal walk, to modest success. He is
				followed by Calida, doing her best military walk.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Hyde walks with a very successful sultry swagger, to which Carina wolf
				whistles. Aphrodite inclines her head. “A seductress? Woman after my own heart.” Hyde replies with a
				wink.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cass follows, his approval of Hyde obvious. Aphrodite cracks a joke, but
				doesn’t summon him a chair.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Jynx tries to skip, not particularly successful with the sand. Instead, she
				runs and slides at Aphrodite.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva summons her wings of fire, coasting to a graceful landing. This gets a
				double eyebrow-raise from Aphrodite, and a chair. “Graceful as a flickering candle.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Magnus does a formal military walk, nailing it. Aphrodite gives him a very
				pretty smile, summoning him a chair. “Take a seat, soldier.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Caminus walks next, using his knowledge of physics to walk more steadily.
				Aphrodite lifts from her chair to watch him walk. She asks him to give a spin. He obliges and attempts a
				spin and falls immediately, causing Aphrodite to erupt in laughter. She offers him a hand up and,
				mesmerized, he accepts. She lifts her hand to his cheek and kisses the other. “You remind me of my
				husband. He makes me laugh as well”. Caminus is star-struck by the goddess. She summons a chair for him
				and he sits.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Eros walks and stands behind her. Aphrodite speaks, saying she’s surprised we
				passed her test so quickly. “Then again, tensions have been high…” She gives a meaningful look to Cass,
				who looks confused. Our attention is drawn to the sun momentarily, and we notice it’s setting much
				faster than it should be. She says she isn’t as gifted as some of the other gods with regards to the
				time dilation… and we come to the realization that we've been there for roughly 48 days (outside time).
				She notices Serena’s forlorn expression, and empathizes. She says that she would also like to be with
				the one she loves, but unfortunately cannot leave the towers, at least not yet. The portal isn’t open
				yet.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">“I suppose I need to give my blessing to one of you,” she begins. She
				compliments Calida, Ignacio, Hyde, and Cassius on their… enthusiasm downstairs. However, it is Carina
				that embodies more of her ideals. She walks out with Carina into the ocean, both walking on the surface
				of the water.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Meanwhile, Calida dips her toes in the surf briefly, before squealing with
				Serena about the blessing of the goddess of love upon her relationship. Honerva tries to make the
				embarrassed Ignacio feel a little better.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Returning after a bit, Aphrodite wishes Serena good luck on her wedding.
				Caminus, still smitten, showers Aphrodite with compliments, asking her as well about his own deity,
				Hephaestus. She says that she can still see his tower, far to the west. Since it still exists… he’s
				still in there. She takes a ring off her finger, holding it up for all to see. She says that true love
				is like damascus steel. Each time you’re worn thin, you grow stronger for it.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva asks where Aphrodite thinks we should go next. She replies that she
				doesn’t know; there are still several towers left and many people that need our protection.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena asks about the Hekatonkheires, who she and Cass saw attacking a
				different tower. It seemed to be seeking the crystals. Aphrodite says that while at first they seemed to
				be seeking mayhem, they now seem to be more organized.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The party moves on, but Caminus hangs back, thanking Aphrodite again. She tells
				him, quietly, that when we meet her husband, bring the one with the strongest armor. He nods and rejoins
				the group, who exit the tower.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">On the way out, Serena talks to Ignacio, apologizing for going off on him. He
				says he understands, and compliments her resolve in the face of adversity. He’s going to see about
				getting her a promotion when they get back.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Exiting the tower, we arrive on the beach, at night time, to find manned
				ballistas aimed at us. The tower shrinks behind us, and Carina wades into the surf to pick up the
				crystal. She ties it into a necklace, putting it around her neck. We find that all the fancy clothes we
				put on didn’t make it out of the tower, and we all put our normal clothes back on.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Desma rides up on horseback, asking Serena and Cass how close the hekkin bad
				boye appeared next to the tower. They reply it came right up next to it, so Desma suggests, since we’re
				very close to the tower, that we take things to the outskirts of town. We feel a hum in the air and
				start running.</p>

			<h3>Prometheus</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">We look to where the tower was to see a portal forming. Readying ourselves for
				the worst, we are instead surprised to see a ten-foot-tall man, facing away from us, appear. He turns
				around and Calida edges Serena into the front of the group. Serena asks who he is, and he says he’s
				Prometheus. He asks where he is, to which she says the mortal plane… Patria, to be specific.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">He says he was stuck on a mountain for 500 years. Calida asks him how he got
				here, to which he summons Gygas, a Hekatonkheires, who emerges from the portal. He says that he met the
				Hek’ recently. We notice that he’s glancing around a lot, and not looking directly at anyone. Eventually
				he focuses his attention to one of the ballistas, approaching it. Calida asks if he’d like to see a
				demonstration, to which he says he’d rather figure it out himself. She then informs him of firearms.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">He says that he’s looking for something. Calida says that all the crystals
				disappeared. He says they didn’t disappear, they just changed form. Calida thinks and asks Jynx for a
				handful of lacrima. “These?” As he looks at her, she feels all her muscles seize up… including her
				heart. After a few moments, he looks away, and Calida collapses. Honerva tries to heal but can’t figure
				out what’s wrong; Caminus heals her instead. She regains consciousness, shell-shocked.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena says that we don’t have what he’s looking for. He turns to Gygas, asking
				if it (he?) can detect any more. The Hek’ responds in the affirmative.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Prometheus asks if we’d be willing to give it up without a fight. We inquire more about what he wants to do, to which he responds that he is trying to stop the gods from regaining power. Prometheus was punished, quite brutally, by Zeus, for bringing fire to humanity. He says he’ll do what he can to ensure they don’t come to power again; their corruption is too great.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">We ask what his plan is. He says he’s not sure; either reopen the gates to Olympus and restructure everything… or end all gods. He says that whom he is tracking smells like brimstone… and fresh cut flowers. Persephone.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">He again asks for the crystals, to which we politely decline. “We have our own tasks.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">“And Gygas does as well.” He enters into the portal and disappears.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">A battle commences. We do some damage, but Magnus and Calida are killed. Both are revived by Desma and sent to go help with the ballistas (sp??). They switch to chains to try to pin/trip up the Hekatonkheires.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">REINFORCEMENTS! The turtle tank squad appears and joins the fray.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Jynx gets to try out her pow pow but the recoil of the lacrima infused projectiles destroys the barrel.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Shout out to Calcifer’s big brother (Honerva’s fire elemental), he did his best and took 3 hits to help protect the turtle tank squad.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The Heka is eventually taken down but we have to keep it pinned as we think only a similar Titan-adjacent/Titan/God can kill it. We’re waiting for dawn now.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">While we wait, we notice that the chains appear to be gold. Desma says that they’re gold plated, and that she’s glad that it worked; apparently gold chains are the only thing that can hold a powerful being.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Discussing Prometheus, we determine that we’re really only supporting the gods because Athena asked us to. However, since he wants to end /all/ gods, that includes Stain, and that’s not about it.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Hyde drags Cassius over to Desma and asks about Hadrian. Desma says he’s doing fine, and that his caretaker is staying at a local inn if he’d like to go see them. Hyde asks Lieutenant Colonel Desma for permission to be dismissed, which she gives. Hyde takes Cassius with her to check on them.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Desma approaches Serena for a report. She says the tower was fancy; basically a mansion. We explored every room, but we couldn’t figure out how to get up the stairs. It got to a point where we were thinking possibly Dionysis; if a party was started it might summon him. We had ideas of Aphrodite, Eros, Dionysis; we started drinking, some members retired to *pause* engage… which worked. Honerva interjects, saying that Jynx deserves much of the credit as well, as she was able to perceive a baby that talked to her, giving her terrible relationship advice. Serena continues. The “acts of love”, as ‘t’wer, were what finally brought out Eros and Aphrodite.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva says Ignacio might require a few days off… he found the entire process quite… harrowing.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena continues. Eros said that we could see the lady now, so we were able to go upstairs. He said we had to get “ready” to see her, so we had to get dressed up. She had us do a “fashion show”, of sorts. She mentions everybody succeeded but Cass. “Everyone is fashionable but Cass.” Honerva says that explains our state of undress upon exiting the tower. The tower clothes disappeared upon the tower disappearing. Desma says that does explain some things.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena mentions that in this tower, about every 15 minutes was a day, as opposed to previous towers where 30 minutes was a day. Carina has Aphrodite’s crystal now. Desma asks Honerva if there’s anything she’d like to add… Honerva says if she meets Eros or Aphrodite again she might try to punch them. And also that there is probably going to be an interesting book coming out soon.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Jynx asks where the forge is. Desma directs her into the town; Jynx trots off.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena sits and watches the Hek’. After a while, the head of the Turtle Tank Squad (Rine? Rhine?) jumps off the pile and heads her way. “Quite the final shot!” He complements. She thanks him for the complement, and thanks him for bringing reinforcements. He says he’s glad they showed up early. He says that normally when we go into towers, it takes much longer. This one seemed to be shorter, only taking about a month.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena asks if his company is alright; he says they’re fine. Only a few of them have broken arms. He says not to worry; they’ll heal stronger than they were.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">In the morning, Honerva meets with Magnus to make sure he’s doing alright. He’s pretty shaken up, but okay in general. She’s glad to hear it.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Later in the morning, Desma has breakfast with Calida and Magnus. She is obligated to tell them that since they perished, they do have the option of an honorable discharge. She would send her report to the capital, then they would have to ask for a discharge. It would mean an end to their mandatory military service with full benefits.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">As dawn rises, those on the beach see a figure steadily charging across it towards them. As she realizes it’s Stain, Serena gives a squeak. He’s barreling towards them at full speed. As he brakes, there’s a wave of sand in front of him. He collides with Serena in an embrace. She finds that she isn’t being burned. He’s got the biggest grin, and he says Desma taught him how to control some stuff. It isn’t 100%, but it’s a lot better than it was.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">He asks her to choose: her, her armor, or her weapon. She chooses herself. He gives her a boop on the shoulder. Something happens that she can feel, but she’s not sure what.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Carina takes Caminus aside and asks him if this is how things normally go. He replies that it isn’t. She then asks what we’re waiting for with regards to the Hek’. He says that he’s not sure.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">A bit later, Desma comes over to Carina and asks if she was the one to receive the crystal. She says she was, and Desma asks her to stick around a while as there is more to do with regards to it.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain reveals that, according to his book, he did in fact die while fighting Apollo.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain wonders how to get rid of the thing. We decide on a bonfire.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">He begins channeling his heat to burn the hekatonkheires and it looks promissing at first but then it becomes clear that it is being absorbed into the ground instead.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida, rather worn out, asks Desma if they can go home… Home home. After some light teasing, we decide to head back to our old base.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Caminus asks Desma for 13 links from the gold-plated chain, which she obliges.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain asks Serena what happened in the tower. He’s intrigued to learn it was a “sexy tower”. She says that she was disgusted to have to be the responsible one. After a brief skinnydipping interlude, she fills him in on the rest. She also tells him about the hecker, who can sense gods, and the person in control of it, who wants to kill them all.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">On the train ride to the capital, we smell familiar flowers, and spot a group of people on the side of the train line, and Calida, Magnus, Serena, and Stain decide to hop off and investigate. Cass gives Serena a potion of magic mouth.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida asks if they have Persephone with them. The leader replies in the affirmative. She warns them that there’s a titan coming for them, and introduces Stain as the god of the written word, bearer of Apollo. They say they did come across something, but it doesn’t meet the description of the Hekatonkheires, nor Prometheus. She says they encountered something over 12 feet tall, with “skin stretched over undulating flesh”. She says that they’re the refugees from a nearby town… all of the refugees. Everyone offers them food and water from their provisions.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena uses the potion to send a message to Desma, asking her to stop the train.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Back on the train, Desma receives a message. She asks Hyde and Jynx to quickly and discreetly stop the train in a non-permanent manner. Caminus mentions that he’s able to cast warp metal, so Jynx shrinks him down and chucks him out the window. Bewildered, he is nevertheless able to cast warp metal on the coupling rod of the train. With a colossal screeching noise, the train grinds to a halt.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The team gets the refugees onto the train and they continue on their way. Heading back to the capitol, Serena goes looking for Jynx. She finds her between trains, her head stuck through a hole she had cut in the fabric tunnel connecting the train. Serena asks her what she’s doing, and Jynx says she’s looking at the mechanics of the train. Serena asks Jynx to be a bridesmaid, and Jynx accepts, although she is disappointed. When Serena asks what she’s disappointed by, Jynx says she’d like to be the maid of honor. Serena doesn’t say no, so Jynx starts planning her battle dress. Calida comes across them and adds a bit here and there.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Arriving back at the capital, we notice some officials waiting at the train station. They approach the refugees and start helping them off the train and getting ready to take them somewhere into town. Calida spots an older elf woman, who seems to be waiting for someone. She says she’s waiting for her ex-husband, Nib. Calida asks her name…</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Meanwhile, Serena heads off the train with Stain in tow. As he disembarks, his posture stiffens. She asks what he’s doing and he says he’s just trying to make his way through the crowd. Serena says that they probably have official business to do, but they should also stop in and see her mother, as she’s probably done a lot of planning since they’ve been gone. He says “Nope, that’s Desma’s job!”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida finds Stain in the crowd, approaching him. “Stain?” she asks, “Cestia over there is looking for her ex-husband, you don’t know who that would be?” When she doesn’t get a response, she tells Serena that his ex-wife is over there looking for him. Serena asks why he doesn’t want to see her, and guesses that maybe he faked his own death. “Bingo!” He says. “Let’s go!”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Much to Stain’s chagrin, Serena wants to go meet her. He says that she’s scary. She says he’s a literal god. He says, “Yeah, and I’m scared, let’s go.” He tells her that she was his old commander, and would very likely outrank him. She also kinda taught him how to fight.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">After a brief discussion, he complies. Approaching, her expression turns to rage. She starts throwing chunks of brick at him from her purse. She explains that while she would love an opportunity to catch up with Valencia (Serena’s mother), she will /not/ be attending his wedding. As it turns out, Serena’s mother put a picture of Stain and Serena on the invitations…</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">(filled in later) Cassius and Hyde had a bit of an argument. She told him how she felt, and Cassius wasn’t quite clarified on his feelings enough to respond in the affirmative. After botching things a few times, Hyde said that she would see him at the wedding.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Magnus sends a letter accepting the discharge that was offered to him by Desma, and within a few hours receives a reply stating that it’ll take a few days to get the paperwork in order, but thanking him for his service nevertheless. He’s welcome to stay in the base until then.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">On the train ride there, we notice that there are a few new areas where houses and businesses are built along the train tracks. Cassius notices that there are wooden poles, about 15 feet from the tracks, spaced regularly, about an hour (at train speed) outside of the capital.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">At each of the towns we stop at on the way to the base, the train stops to exchange cargo. Everyone bolts off the train as soon as the doors open. The first town we stop at, Macilia, is pretty deserted. Magnus heads off in search of some food, and finds many of the stalls unoccupied. He gets meat on a stick from a meat on a stick vendor, and Serena asks where everyone is. He says everyone’s “down the rail” in Antus, for a week-long festival. That’s where we’re headed next, so everyone boards the train again.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius, wracked with worry, gets next to no sleep the next night. Honerva has a difficult night too, due to the motion of the train and the presence of the other passengers.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">We arrive in Antus around midday the next day, and the train attendants let us know the train will be stopping for six hours, both to load/unload and give us time to explore. We notice that there are many scantily-clad people around. Stain suddenly remembers it’s a nudity festival! Well, almost.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Everyone disrobes into various states of undress. From Calida and Serena at the scanty end, to Magnus, Caminus, Honerva, and Ignacio at the more reserved end.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida gets got by the sticker boogie man and Cassius gets propositioned by a couple to be their third. A few more people get got too. The meat on a stick is shaped like “meat.” Then the race starts. Stain, Ignatio, Honerva, Magnus, Caminus, and Serena, as well as Desma and Jynx clear the pack with Stain, Ignation, and Honerva in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place respectively. Caminus decides to use his engineering knowledge to go for kneecaps. Magnus shouts. And together they take down Serena. Caminus pulls ahead of them both. Jynx lasos Desma and levitates behind her (like a sled dog). It doesn’t go well for them as Desma is trying to get loose while not running Jynx into things.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena gets helped up by a man in a festival mask. He says he met her a few days ago. Tis Prometheus!!!!! She manages to chat with him as they run and shakes off the paralysis after accidentally catching his eye. That surprises them both. He seems to agree to talk to the group? Unfortunately, Prometheus hadn’t previously know about Stain. And he needs the blood of an Olympian to get to Olypmus. Serena tells him to “f*** right off.” Prometheus chuckles and tells her that now he won’t have to keep going after crystals. Stain may have given Serena a blessing to resist his glance. Serena told Prometheus he was firing blanks, she is done with tact. He calls her his spitfire and says he’s got a race to run-he jogs ahead and she loses him.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Race Order: Stain, Ignatio, Honerva, Caminus, Magnus, Serena, Desma, Jynx, Calida, Cassius!</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain wins a grand feathered headdress, Igantio wins a feathered skirt, and  Honerva wins a colorful stuffed pheasant.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena grabs the rest of the group and relays this information (Prometheus’s presence and that she talked shit to him (after trying diplomacy)) to them.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Group eventually goes home to the base, everyone visits everyone else</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">We’re all informed that we’re going to be going to a big ceremony to recognize our courage and valor and another tower down, etc etc. We arrive and are seated, and an announcer starts (most of us drown them out), stating that they wish to recognize one of our number for taking responsibility when others could not. He announces that they are awarding the Golden Fist to one Serena Procula. Surprised, she stands and takes the stage, seeing her family seated nearby. She thanks Ignacio, who awards her as per tradition. “No, thank you.” He places the pin on her lapel. “Introducing… Major Serena Procula.”</p>
			
			<h3>Gotta get them papers!</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">There’s a new guy on the block ‘New Magnus’ (sometimes called Dorian).</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena and Stain get hitched. Serena does better than anticipated in the ceremonial fight. Her mother commissioned a hotel to be built but it was rushed so it’s the Russian Olympic Village.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">We had a water fight after doing our chores around base.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cas and Hyde get a professional picture taken with Hadrian. Uneventful train ride, happy baby, no bathroom accidents. All is good.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Hyde and Cass make up  - she made him a pocket watch that tells the time on the outside of the towers</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">We all get 3 free days:</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius and Hyde take Hadrian for the day and get their picture taken for the pocketwatch.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva meanders around town, chats with bubbly well water guy, instigates a dodgeball game, and writes a letter to Fulvia.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius begins working on an alchemical project making lacrima bullets that can hold magic</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Dorian tries to get to know/observe the others at the base.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena honeymoons and talks to Ignatio (???) for advice.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Caminus is working on his fancy hammers but he also spends some time in town. He is looking for a realtor-either the mayor or a gossip (Olek). Caminus chooses Olek. (The kids are playing a new game.) Olek tells him about a ruined temple property about a mile north of town in the woods. A farmer is an owner of the property and Olek gives Caminus his name. Following Olek’s directions, Caminus is able to go check it out and the stone foundation is still there and looks fantastic. Now onward to the farmer-an old, ornery, female halfling (Sandy). After much miscommunication, she comes around to selling the property to him (under some conditions). He has to keep her farming equipment sharp and maintained and he must build in the style that was there before (she knows, they were her ancestors (land was in her family for 8 generations!), and she has some old paintings in the basement). Inside her hobbit house, she pulls out some painting tubes and unrolls one painting-tis Demeter! If he works the temple back to exactly how it looks in her painting (structure-wise), she will sell it to him free of charge.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Upon returning, Caminus is waylaid by Calida. She brings him to the armory to show him a large stained glass piece featuring Caminus meeting Aphrodite. Cassius gets a hug for being involved in creating the glass and Jynx glomps Caminus to the ground.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Now Caminus and Jynx, along with a moderately unwilling Cas and a curious Calida all take Jynx’s mechanical horse/spider to town. It seats 2 but Jynx makes it bigger. Everyone gets to work a leg. Jynx’s leg does not sync at all with the other 3. Faceplant. Now it’s a race because the plan was to get a keg and Jynx can shrink it. Caminus gets squished a bit when the horse shrinks without warning and Jynx wins the race but no more incidents. They get the keg.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida asks Serena if Serena’s mom would put up some of her places somewhere. Serena says it seems to be in her mom’s taste and she’ll ask no problem. Artist Calida!! :)</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">After the 3 days:</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Carina and Tadita are coming in on an evening train and Honerva, Serena, Cas, and Dorian meet them in town to escort them to the base. We overhear a man being thrown from a tavern. He doesn’t need this hick town, apparently. The bouncers have it handled.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Carina runs up to Serena and asks her about her wedding. They chat as we make our way back to base. Serena also asks Tadita about Persephone’s tower.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius also gets asked about how his romance is going by Carina. Cas says things are going great and asks Carina how she is. She gives him train gossip.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">We all reach the base just before dinner time.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">While Cas is working in the armory (on lacrima spell holding bullets), he hears Jynx singing a song about something going “boom boom boom then slash slash slash then boom boom boom” and starts looking for her. He has no luck though. He eventually asks Hyde and she says Jynx was working on a “special project.” Eventually he gives up and goes back to work. Giggling happens then Jynx appears right behind Cas. Jynx has a good deal of insight into Cas’s project (she’s been doing the same thing). The base is also now a trap designed (concentric circles under the base you need to be small to reach) to hopefully kill anything teleporting/dimension hopping into the vicinity of the base. Also also, Jynx made better lacrima when she was bored in the capital. But that’s a secret.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Jynx and Cas are in business now-Cas gets the rights to her lacrima bullet stuff/process but he agreed to do something (a secret) for her.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Meanwhile, Honerva went down to the stable to feed and exercise the horses and Dorian came down to help out. Chomp is not a fan of Dorian and bites him when Dorian brushes him too hard. Honerva tries to heal check him and does not good. They finish up with the horses and Chomp gets irked at Dorian again (but does not bite him again).</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva wants to have music time so she decides to find Serena. Dorian is invited along (but they need to find a drum). They find Serena and decide to find Jynx or Cas to see if they can make a drum. They end up using pots and pans (and spoons) as drums for Jynx and Dorian, Serena uses her lute, Caminus comes in singing and headbanging and Honerva sings too. Honerva and Dorian do decently but the other three sound like dying cats. Caminus knocks himself out by accidentally.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">While music time is happening, Cassius has a wine tasting lesson with Ignatio and they actually have a nice time. Cas is a knowledgeable and enthusiastic student and Ignatio enjoys teaching enough to forget that he isn’t a fan of Cas. The rest of the base gets to have a wine party with the tasters.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cas also talks to Hyde about his deal with Jynx. Hyde isn’t thrilled but eventually agrees that if he put the info/theory to good instead of war than she doesn’t object to what he does with it.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The next morning Jynx reveals that her thing is ready. She kicks his knee to get him down on one knee and hands him a small box. Jynx then yells for Hyde. “I don’t suppose this is something you’d object to?”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">H: “That was the worst I’ve ever heard. You have 10 seconds to fix it. One. Two-”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cas: “Will you marry me?!”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">H: SLAP</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">But Cas doesn’t drop the ring.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">H: “Two. Three. Four.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cas” “Would you please-”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">H: “Five. Six”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">J: “Tell her why she should marry you, dumbass”-Jynx</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">H: “Seven. Eight.” Hyde’s hand moves toward her whip.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">(The entire base is watching. Cas and Hyde were the only ones not in on this plan.)</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">H: “Nine.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cas: “Ignatia-”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">H: “Is that a question?”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">S: “What about that sappy shit you told us in the city?!”-Serena from around the bend.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cas: “Look, I’m really bad at this and I apologize for this. Um. i-at this point can’t exactly imagine any part of my life without you. And. and. Lets face it. You are definitely my better half. Like definitely absolutely the only good thing about me.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida: “Groveling?”-Calida</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cas: “ I’m good at groveling thanks to you. [to Hyde]. I don’t have much but everything i have i would like to share with you. And if that is something you’d like. Would you please consider marrying me? Could you tell I didn’t plan this out well?”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">H: “It’s exactly like your other speeches. I love you.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cas: “I love you too.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">H: “And despite you being a coward who would never take initiative-yes.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The ring is adamantine with a lacrima piece. It’s got a cool design</p>

			<h3>Procula Hotel Is Falling Down</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Later in the day the wind picks up. That evening, Desma summons everyone. There has been an incident in town. People are in danger and we need to move immediately. Serena asks for more details and Desma responds it wasn’t clear but the message said houses were being destroyed.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">As we head into town, we see people looking out of houses. Serena stops to ask what’s going on, and is told “the monstrous thing in town… the wall fell down” We look around, but through the storm that’s raging it’s hard to see. Calida and Serena see part of a house fall into the street, but are unable to see what did it, leading us over to it.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">We make our way to Serena’s family’s hotel, which appears to be falling apart. Cassius get beaned in the face by a doorstop. After a couple of failed attempts, Calida pistolwhips the door open. A bellhop pops up from behind the counter to say the door was open.He is sent out of the hotel.  Desma approaches and says that they’re going to evacuate the houses, while we find a way to take the hotel down from inside. Serena realizes she still has a tiny keg of black powder…</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">We find out which rooms are still occupied (107, 120, 129 , 203, 204, 333) and Cassius, Dorian, and Serena go to evacuate the rooms. Caminus and Calida try to find the weak points to take the building down (Honerva tries to help them but is very bad at it). Honerva notices that one of the walls is colder than the rest, and they break it, to find that it is filled with water leaking from the roof. She decides she would be of more use healing townspeople outside of the hotel. Two people have hurt legs. She’s able to completely heal them both and they dance a celebratory jig (a hootenanny, even).</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Dorian goes to the third floor. Knocking on the door, he hears two people shouting. Busting the door down, he finds an elderly couple, the man of which turns to fight him. As he does so, Dorian is treated to the sight of a single dangling testicle, descending from his ratty briefs. They don’t move so Dorian takes his ant haul potion and uses his (one monk thing, I don’t remember) and bodily carries the couple to safety. They struggle for freedom.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena goes to the second floor. She finds the first door she tries locked, and picks the lock. The bed is made up and the only things out of place appear to be the chair and a full ashtray. No one responds to her hello so she checks the second room. It is also locked so she pounds on the door. No response so she picks the lock. It’s a couple having sex. The dude argues that he can’t leave yet or he’ll get blue balls, Serena shoots that down and calls him a liar, and the lady leaves in the sheet. He wants to do the do with Serena now. She is not impressed and leaves him there. He waddles after her wearing a tiny bathroom towel. He is...something else (average vape shop/library/department store customer that you push off onto someone else). She has to push past him and he only moves when she points a blade downward. She makes it back to the 1st floor.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius goes to the first floor. He finds the first room empty, and downs a detect thoughts potion, heading for the nearest detected thoughts. After opening the second door, he finds a sleeping woman. It’s hard to see in the dark but once he gets closer he notices her wearing earmuffs. Cas tries to pull them off and notices she’s got ear plugs in too. So Cas shakes her. Her eyes open and she has trouble focusing but she is now awake. He is able to pull her into a sitting position but her eyes are crossed and her eyes are wondering. There is a half-full glass on the bedside table and it is a not-clear liquid. She slurs really bad and asks “are we outside?”. It is probably because of the incoming water. Cas sniffs the cup and it smells like whiskey. He pulls her ear plugs out and she clutches her head in pain. While she puts the plugs back in, Cas takes an ant haul potion and goes to pick her up (motioning, not grabbing) and she does not notice. Second try, she notices and she’s okay with being picked up. She starts out smiling but abruptly vomits on his chest.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Caminus has been examining the walls and he found a crudely drawn floor map for the first and second floors. He is working on finding real stone walls.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva hears a second house go down so she rushes over to see if anyone needs help. She can’t tell if anyone is there but it looks like someone broke into the house. She hears a boom from behind her and another house is dead now. (3 dead houses and 2 more wounded houses). The third dead house had a broken open lock box with some fabric in it so Honerva hides it in a mostly intact closet (to keep it safer from looters). While in the house, she hears another house go down and she sees Stain running past her. Honerva saves a kitty from a basement.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Dorian notices that water is coming from under some of the doors. The elderly people are not reacting to this. Dorian attempts to convince them to be willing creatures so he can carry them to safely. They just start arguing with each other. He decides, having failed diplomacy, to just punch them out, then carry them out. Both get knocked out cold.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena’s Jerk made his way out to the others on the first floor. They hear Stain’s voice coming from the area. “Here, let me escort you to safety” and the man whoops out of sight.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Just then the hotel shakes and Dorian and Caminus are in trouble. Dorian is still on the 3rd floor and holding the old people so he tries to land in a way to cushion their fall when he goes through the floor. Some debris falls on Caminus.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Dorian gets his old people to the exit and sees Stain carrying a naked man out by his neck. Naked people bros! So many naked people in this hotel.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva sees Stain with the man and is convinced he’s gonna kill him so she gets in the way. She gets Stain to swear (on Serena’s boobs) that he won’t kill or maim the man.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Caminus gets unburied and continues checking rooms/walls. Everyone else starts breaking the marked walls.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The hotel shakes again and Calida is standing near a door. A strong wind knocks a window in and broken glass hits Calida.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cas gets his drunkie to the door and passes her off to Honerva, wiping her down a bit so Honerva doesn’t get vomit all over her too. Calida isn’t so good at smashing so she comes out. Honerva calls her over to help with drunkie and Calida accidentally lets her drink more alcohol, gets her to puke it back up, and tells her to sit down somewhere safe.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Meanwhile, Cas makes some delayed explodies (one time because we real life goofed). The building is coming down faster and bigger pieces are falling on houses so Cas (void bombs) and Caminus (shatter spell) pick up speed on the side with less destroyed houses.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida and Honerva are looking for people who need help outside. Calida notices a kid in the safe zone with a leg cut.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena, now outside, sees Stain with the naked man and tells him he was obnoxious but not kill worthy, and decides to shoot angry arrows through top floor windows.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva finds some kids (a girl and a boy) throwing a sign around and she asks them to move a little further back because danger. The older sister tilts the sign and Honerva notices it’s a Hotel Procula sign.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Caminus and Cassius are busy destroying walls when they feel the building shake again. Both are hit with heavy debris. Eight houses are now destroyed :(</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Caminus gets out but the hotel falls down on Cassius. Cas notices time seems to be dialating (?).  A piece of rubble is coming at him but it is growing. Just before impact, everything goes black and the noise is almost deafening. But he doesn’t feel anything hit him. Cas switches to darkvision and finds himself in a metallic dome. Jynx is inside the dome with him. Jynx made an adamantine seashell type thing and shrunk them to put them in. She wanted a bowl she could eat out of forever. “Nobody notices the tiny Jynx-nobody!”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain puts himself and the jerk in the path of a falling pillar and makes him think he’s about to be crushed but saves him at the last minute by throwing him into the mud instead.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">With everyone out of the hotel, Caminus and Cassius begin destroying the supports. At the last one, Cassius yells at Caminus to get out while he destroys the last one and brings the building down on top of himself. Just before being crushed he shrinks and Jynx cackles explaining how she’s covered them both with an adamantine bowl to keep them safe.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Caminus casts Fabricate a few times, to turn the rubble into neat, organized piles of stone, lumber, and other building materials. Concentrating on his spell, he doesn’t see Cass and Jynx, his oversize form lumbering toward them. Jynx takes out Pow Pow Jr., lamenting the loss of her adamantine bowl. It grows from miniscule size to proper size, relative to Cass and Jynx. She aims it at Caminus and fires. She hits him in the torso. Thankfully, the difference in size is such that it feels like the bite of a fly. Stopping his casting, he reaches into his torso and pulls out a small metal ball, which he tosses onto the ground… causing a 6” explosion. Cassius and Jynx are blown onto their asses by the blast. Undeterred, she rises and fires again, hitting him the right leg. Cassius uses his Fire Breath potion, aiming it straight up. Unfortunately, Caminus sees this as an errant fire, and stops at it. Luckily, Cass jumps out of the way in time.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Finally, Jynx embiggens the two of them. Still upset by the loss of her bowl, she threatens Caminus again with the cannon. Confused, Caminus says if there was any adamantium it’s going to be in a small pile over there somewhere. Jynx starts crying.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Everyone reunites. Calida and Cass encourage Serena to talk to the townsfolk and apologize. Serena defers to Desma for advise. She says to begin preparations for tents in the meantime, and leave rebuilding to the town. We’ll lend what aid we can, but other priorities should come first. Serena says she’ll contact her mother. Stain hands Serena his wand of Magic Mouth, then faceplants into the mud. Cassius pick him up and we all head off.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The townsfolk are holed up in a local school. Serena tells them that there were a few injuries, and a few homes were destroyed, but some of them are still standing. Serena gives a small speech, saying that she’s sorry for the state of the hotel and for the incident, and she’ll talk to her mother about compensation for those whose houses were damaged. Privately, Serena asks the mayor for a list of families whose homes were destroyed.</p>
			
			<h3>Devil is in the Details</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius Hyde and Hadrian go to the capital for a few days. Cass intends to get a lawyer to look over his grandfather’s will and start pushing paperwork through to reclaim his inheritance. Hyde is picking up some materials for Jynx while they're there.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">While sleeping they hear Hadrian fussing except the sound is way too close. Both wake up to find a humanoid creature holding the baby in a very threatening fashion telling them both to be still and quiet or else he’d kill the baby. Yay meet the murder that’s been plaguing the city. Cassius remembers that the descriptions of the victims were all the same. The couple always in bed together, the mother slashed to bits and bled out, the father dead with a single stab to the heart with no signs of struggle.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Hyde’s pistol is on the bedside table, Cassius’ gear is off to the side as well, neither in easy reach.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cas goes to see one of Cadoc’s matches and sits with Cados’c half orc fans. While he’s there he sees Fulvia and her sisters at the colosseum. They say they’re gonna go visit Honerva for a few days (A SURPRISE :) ) and they’re all gonna be on the same train back.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Meanwhile, Caminus is clearing rubble at the land he’s building a temple on and Sandy pulls up a folding chair to watch him work. He tries to her to help and she is not about it. Asks him if he’s trying to change the terms of their deal. Having already spent hours working her fields, she does not want to help him move stones. (She’s already moved enough stones from the fields to make the wall around her property.) Cam tries to get her to not watch him and says he doesn't work with “barbaric dirt” and she says, “fine! We’ll see about that” and picks up her chair and leaves. She proceeds to throw dirt clods at him for the next several days. Cam makes some progress with trees (but he wants to find a contractor if one’s still around for advice). He also has to talk to Sandy again because she’s got the blueprint painting.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Caminus is trying to find where Sandy is throwing dirt from. He succeeds! He gets hit right in the chest and finds her leaning up against a tree. She agrees to let him make a copy of the painting. He explains that he wants to get someone more used to working with wood to give him some advice (and he wants to not get hit with dirt for a bit). She chuckles, says she has no idea what he’s talking about, and says “let’s get this done.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The sketch isn’t too hard to manage and they have a decently easy time finding a carpenter. He’s a grumpy sounding old man named Jesus. He proceeds to try to convince him to help with his business proposition. Cam isn’t getting very far until he mentions paying him. He agrees to work out a blueprint and says he’ll have his guys find Cam when it’s done in a few days. And Cam pays him 120 gold to do it (20 is a tip).</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Onto Serena. She’s feeling really depressed and crushed by responsibility so she’s gonna go find Magnus and have a breakdown. She also wants to borrow his paints. She wants to deface whatever part of the hotel is still standing. (Her hobby from the Capital was grafitti.) (Cas knows her work but not that she’s the artist.) Her signature is a crescent moon. She paints dicks. And arrows. Doodly stuff.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida has been making stained glass.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva’s been feeling useless from the last couple of missions and she’s moping around. Calida pulls her into being a helper as a distraction.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Dorain checks in with Serena to see if there are any duties he could perform and then wanders around. He ends up helping out the construction workers. Jesus is happy for the free labor.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Now Cassius’s drama (after the Colosseum):</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cadoc comes into the stands in a big coat. He goes over to Fulvia’s section and he gives her a big hug and a quick kiss (bad angle to tell what kind of kiss). Cas can’t understand what they’re saying but they both seem very happy. They quickly leave after.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Now on the train-Cas notices there are a lot of guards at the station. “...I hate trains.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">As the train is still coming (10 minutes out), there is a circle of guards around some people. Cas is able to see two men, one much younger than the other. They look to be human. The younger one is begging the older one for something.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cas takes a thought reading potion. Cas is only able to pick up the young man’s voice. ‘I don’t want to do this. This can’t be happening.’ (on repeat) No other thoughts stand out.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">*Note, Hyde and Hadrian are with Cas. Fulvia and her sisters are somewhere too.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Hyde notices Cas doing something and asks what he’s up to. She freaks out when Cas tells her. Apparently Cas was spying on the Consul and his companion and if any guards caught on to Cas, the guards would kill him for being a spy. Cas agrees to stop borrowing trouble. And Cas regrets out loud not saving the potion for Fulvia. Hyde questions why spying on Fulvia. She noticed and didn’t think it was remarkable. Hyde says the were together for years (friends and couple/friends with benefits(??)). The rest of us thought they were just good friends. SURPRISE! Hyde didn’t know Cas didn’t know.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Now the train is coming into the station.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The Consul and guards go into a compartment and push the other random people out. Cas and Co. get on the train too and Fulvia and sisters’ seats are on the opposite side of the train. Cas goes looking for Fulvia but is stopped by a guard. Cas says he’s looking for someone but gets told nobody gets to pass. Guard doesn’t recognize Fulvia’s name so Cas comes back to his seat. Hyde is reading with one hand and playing with Hadrian with the other. Hadrian is a good baby that day. Cas spends time carving. Hyde reassures him that there will be stops and they can find them later/move to a different car. There is a 3 hour stop. Cas tries again to find Fulvia around town. Local shopkeepers tell him she was around but he keeps missing her. Cas likes Honerva enough to find out if her marriage is about to crumble around her ears. He isn’t able to find her in the 3 hours so they try to pick another train car on the other side of the train.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Finally Cas spots her and she’s sitting with her sisters and Cadoc. They’re playing cards to pass the time. No open seats around them, though there are some open seats in the car but there are other passengers too so sitting with strangers. Cas greets them. Que the smalltalk. Cadoc is coming for a visit too. They want to get Hyde involved in cards when they finally manage to sit near each other the next day.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Next day, they’re all in the same car. Hyde, Cas, Fulvia, and Cadoc are now playing cards while the sisters are cooing over Hadrian. Hyde starts doing bad, goes to the bathroom, then does phenomenally. Cas himself is doing well (but less well than Hyde). Hyde slyly slides Cas some cards even though she’s still got a full hand. Smalltalk interrogation continues. They planned to come together and are confused about why Cas is confused that they keep in contact. They ask Cas about his limp on his way back from the bathroom. “We had a rough night.” No elaboration. Cadoc blushes really hard while Fulvia laughs.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">They finally arrive in town and Cadoc goes to find lodging and talk to some people in town. He’ll meet them at the base in a bit. The people outside the base notice them all walking up and they notice that Cas and Hyde both have the same limp. Cas finally breaks and asks Fulvia whether her and Cadoc are a thing. She says not really. They’ve been reconnecting a bit. She wants to talk to Honerva about certain things. Cas feels better now that he knows it isn’t going to be kept from Honerva.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva, having been released from Calida, is in the stable brushing Titan when Fulvia appears. We have a mighty hug. We chat a bit too. Then Fulvia drops the bomb that her and Cadoc have gotten closer again and we need to renegotiate our relationship. Honerva did like Cadoc too and wants Fulvia to be happy so she is, tentatively (at the moment), okay with talking to them about the future.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Dorian notices first that Cas and Hyde have identical limps. He asks them about it and Hyde tells Cas “Oh no, you explain. This is all your fault.” And walks away with Hadrian.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">C: This wasn’t entirely my fault</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida: Hyde is missing a toe.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">It was kinky (afterwards)? Cas says Hyde did it to him-he didn’t do it to her. Cas tells Serena her parents are safe and they took out the murderer.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Everyone is more confused.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cas got his inheritence paperwork expidited and it put him and Hyde on a list of rich parents with a single heir which brought the murder down on them. We are mostly drama queens. It’s terrible.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva comes in extra confused and gets told Hyde got mangled by a serial killer than Cas got mangled by Hyde. They literally took him with them to Cadoc’s gladiator match. They didn’t fight. He threatened them not to move or hurt baby, he attacked Hyde, then Cas moved-which broke the contract? He was a devil? Now they’re friends? The contract was with a romantic idiot who is already dead. The devil is out of juice because the contract was broken and he’ll be going away soon. (Cas is kinda bad at explaining.) We know devils make rock-solid contracts that benefit them (bound to their word). Demons make contracts full of loopfulls they never really intend to keep. Devils are apparently pretty neat. He was a cool Greater Devil. Calida has heard his name before. He took Hadrian for a walk while Cas and Hyde did other things. Because apparently he could be trusted to do this (via Hyde’s orders). When everyone was done, they all went out to the colosseum. Hadrian is probably gonna grow up to be a summoner.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva gets into a fight with Cas (and Calida) about the value of lives and weighing some lives as being of more value. Hyde threatens to shoot the next person who calls Hadrian useless. Honerva ends up walking away huffing “*grumble* drows *grumble*”</p>
			
			<h3>Devil is in the Details</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Olek catches Serena post-tagging the hotel. She invites him to sit down next to her. He’s got a chair cane thing from Jynx. He tells her about a flock of guards heading north. And to tell Desma that someone was wondering around asking about her and the base. He was large with a bushy braided beard (according to his informants) (who are the kids) (but they’re paid well) (and Serena passed on her thanks and respect to them) (so now they get an extra candy) So Serena packs up the borrowed paint set and heads back to the base. She is able to verify by footsteps. She stealthily approaches the base as her hackles are up. She spots two guards making expanding circles around the base. She sneaks by them and sends a mental shoutout to Stain about what’s she’s going on with the soldiers. She also finds two more guards are stationed outside the main base.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Now onto the people in the base (just after noon).</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">An explosion rocks the armory. And the door is kicked in by royal guards. Everyone in the armory is told to get to the walls and informed that a Consul is outside. Calida gestures to the spent shell (she tapped too hard) to explain the explosion.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva hears from the bathroom so she haphazardly gets dressed and goes to the armory.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Meanwhile, desma, Stain, and Magnus head toward the main door. Someone has knocked. Stain recognizes the person. “Hey, it’s you.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">“You’re still here?!”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">It’s the same guards who dropped Stain off. The man instructs our people to put down their weapons. Stain puts his hands in his pockets, Magnus puts his kitchen knife in a random coat by the door, and Desma puts her weapon away.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Consul Clavicus steps forward and tells Stain he needs to speak to him privately. Stain says fine but Desma needs to come. He reluctantly agrees but mentions that he wants to keep this quiet. So they (and the Consul’s son) go to the main office.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Magnus offers lemonade to the guard in the hall.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Meanwhile, everyone else is allowed to leave the wall. Calida asks what a Consul is doing there but nobody answers.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Once allowed to move, Calida finds Ignatio to find out what’s going on. He doesn’t know beyond what he’s eavesdropped. They go find Cassius and plop down next to him. They have decided to babysit him.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva goes to finish her after bath stuff.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Back to Serena. She recognizes the people as royal guards. She decides to use the ring and potion of invisibility she got from Cas. She tries to find an unguarded door with no luck. All of a sudden, she hears running footsteps going from Stain and her room and away from her-further into the base. Continuing her circuit, she comes near the bathroom and she hears footsteps again. She heads toward the bathroom window. It’s small but open. She goes for it-attempting to shimmy through the window. She makes it easily into the base. She decides to hide in a stall and listen to try to figure anything out.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Having finished her bath, Honerva goes to try to find Cas, as he seems to be the knower of things and he came from the Capital.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cas keeps getting the stink eye from a protroling guard but Cas and Hadrian charm him. Hadrian is very cute. They make a guard friend.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena, on the other hand, is still listening. She hears more footsteps but also the guard fussing over the baby. So she drops her invisibility, innocently meanders out of the bathroom, and walks into the nursery with everyone else for the scoop. We tell her we don’t know anything yet but everyone’s fine. So we play cards and explain to our guard how shady we all are (and we invite him to play too). Until...we get summoned for an announcement. Ignacio collects the others not present, which takes some more time.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain: “The Consul has decided that his son is to be stationed here. Meet your new comrade Barbas.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida actually asks why here? Last year aside, we aren’t a base famous for “pedigree soldiers.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The Consul says he “was hoping to put his son Barbas into a base where he would get some recognition as well as a good foundation as to how things should be run. Under the tutelage of Stain, I hope he will proceed well.” This elicits some mirth from the party. The Consul looks confused and angry with the laughter. Serena tries to explain away the laughter as husband and wife inside jokes. He doesn’t bite. Calida asks to speak and tries to explain that Stain is “friendly” and that we all have a closer bond than regular units. This also confuses him as his reports show Stain as usually distant from his comrades. So he and Stain go off to the side to talk again. Dorian, Calida, and Cassius make out the conversation. Stain admits that he’s “tired, and just… doesn’t want to lead anymore”, so he pretty much lets Desma take charge, and “stamps any papers she gives him”.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The Consol responds, “God dammit,  you’re so fucking lazy… How did you get so lazy? I used to look up to you, you know!” Stain responds with a beleaguered, “I know.” The Consol asks why Stain even came down here, if all he wanted was a cushy job, he could’ve gotten that in the Capital. Stain responds that he hears giggling and they need to move further away for additional privacy.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">A short while later, they emerge from his office, the Consol saying, “Well, if she’s as good as you say she is, this will be a good place for him anyway. I’ll leave it up to your judgement.” They rejoin the group and address us once more.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Consol: “I trust that you all get along well… I guess I’ll leave you to it.” He then turns to Barbas. “I expect good things.” He shakes Stain’s hand and says, “Thank you for your honesty.” To Desma: “Can I have a word with you? A bit further away than last time.” They leave.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain puts an arm around Barbas and introduces everybody. “This Honerva, she’s blind. This is Augustus, he’s a person. This is Calida, she’s here on a work release from the Underdark.” She interjects, “I’m a citizen now, I married this one,” she grabs Ignacio.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">“This is Jynx, don’t go along with any of her experiments.” Calida admonishes her not to shoot him out of a cannon, mentioning that Caminus has already volunteered for that position.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">“This is my wife, Serena. She’s also a marksman, but she’s not as speedy as Ignacio.” She responds, “I think you’ll have fun here.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">“This is Hyde. She will shoot you if you say the wrong things; she probably doesn’t care that you’re the Consol’s son.” “She uses rubber bullets on teammates!” interjects Cass</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Stain moves on to Cass: “Be aware of him, he’s very sneaky but he’s very bad at it. Also he has a baby. Meet the baby, he’s adorable.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">“This one eats and poops, that’s about it. But he is very wonderful! And totally useful!” He says, eyeing hyde nervously.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">“This is Tadita and Carina, they’re both shard carriers.” “Oh,  you have two?” “We have four!”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">“This is Octavian and Eve, I don’t know anything about them either.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">“This is Caminus, he’s a dwarf who likes building things… so he’s a dwarf.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">“This is Dorian, he speaks with an accent.”</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">“And last but not least, is Fizz. She’s odd, that’s all I’ve gotten from her so far. Kinda bitchy.” She glares at him.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena says we should have a party tonight, to initiate him the right way. They also decide to play drunk dodgeball.</p>

			<h3>Play Ball!</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida’s Team: Caminus, Honerva, Ignatio, Tadita, Hyde</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena’s Team: Dorian, Barbas, Cassius, Jynx, Carina</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Carina is knocked out first. She’s more interested in watching and creating new ships.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Honerva goes down next. She’s doing her best to dodge but Jynx is throwing extra balls and has snuck in a bunch of marble sized balls that she’s making bigger to throw.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cassius then tries to throw a ball at Tadita and it disintegrates into thin air. He’s then hit. “No fair!” She responds that no one said they couldn’t use abilities and Jynx has enough that she isn’t worried about replacing any.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Then Serena gets hit mid wind-up by Calida.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Jynx doesn’t really like her odds (team is losing) so she pulls out a small item, hears a ‘pop’, and Calida gets wacked in the face with a suddenly bigger dodgeball. So Calida yells”You damn, dirty cheat!”, charges, and tackles Jynx over the fencepost.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Cas tries to tell Tadita she can’t play (because they’re throwing out cheaters) so she comes to the center of the field and tells him to say it again. He repeats and then tries to hide. She keeps walking toward him, says “fine” and shoves a flower stem right into his mouth.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The losers begin to continue their drinking.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Barbas loses next.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Now it’s Dorian vs Caminus, Ignatio, and Hyde.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Dorian takes Hyde out (she isn’t used to dodging) and she glares at him all the way off the field.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Ignatio caught a ball so Calida was put back in but immediately gets knocked back out.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Finally, Ignatio is out and Dorian wins!</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">After celebrating, Serena goes searching for Desma to tell her about the man in town. Stain exclaims that he figured it out. Stain has decided to take Cas’s bed away to give to the new guy.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">It took him a dodgeball game to convince Desma to let him take Cas’s bed away. (Hyde is not gonna share her hammock so, while Cas has been banished to the armory, he’s gonna have to sort himself a hammock in his corner.)</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">While Serena talks to Desma, Stain is going to precariously place Cas’s stuff over the forge. The description is both nondescript and worrying (as that could mean Prometheus). So Serena is told to pick some people from the group to go with her and Desma to talk to Olek. Honerva, Caminus, and Dorian volunteer. Calida decides to stay with the new guy.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena pulls Cas aside to tell him to go take care of his stuff cause Stain- and Cas is gone before she can finish. Cas sees a web of rope above the forge and all his stuff up in it. “How did you even do this?!” “With joy” :) -Stain. Stain puts all his energy to fun things anymore and he sits perched on a table watching Cas get his things down. Jynx points out all the good places to sleep, including on the anvil. Serena pops into the armory to say goodnight to Stain and Serena gets a goodnight and a dip-kiss.</p>
			
			<h3>Onto Olek’s</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Olek is there with Olivia and her little cousin. He is apparently the one who saw the man but he doesn’t like to talk to strangers. Serena negotiates with Olivia for her to act as intermediary and they pull aside to talk but the boy doesn’t seem to be moving his mouth. She’s able to get that the man was seen from a distance and he was asking about Serena, Stain, Desma, Tadita, Carina, and Calida. The man seems to have been about 5’10” with brown hair, tan, with a long braided beard (6-8” long). He was wearing a green shirt with brown pants. And he had a warhammer on his right hip. And he smelled funny, like a fireplace. Before we leave, the kids stop us to tell us that the man asked about Stain’s bedtime. (It was his parents the man was originally talking to and he did see out the window that the man knocked on a few other houses.)</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Back at the base, they notice Dorian running up. He huffs his way through explaining what just happened. Cas goes to tell Stain he may be in immediate danger. Calida goes to ask Tadita if she’s got any way to ward or extra defend. She can’t protect an area but she’s been working on blessings with the other crystal holders. But her blessing hasn’t been tested yet. Calida volunteers and is asked to gather everyone to do a blessing. So we gather. (Stain is groggy but still awake.)</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena gets a weapon blessing from Stain. He tells her to test it so she focuses on a training dummy. It hits the target than bounces off. She tries again and once again it bounces off the target. The arrows are blunt. Stain’s weapon blessing allows the choice between lethal and nonlethal damage. Serena chooses to not go to someone else for a weapon blessing. Stain also tries an armor blessing on Serena. So they test that by having Stain shoot Serena’s bow at her. After he manages a hit, the armor is reinforced and she feels a bit more spry. (+2 to AC).</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida asks Tadita to bless her gun. The wood grain shifts to a different pattern. Calida shoots off a dozen rounds and they don’t seem to be doing much. (Keen) (Does not stack).</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Caminus asks Tadita to bless him. He feels the energy wash over him but he can’t tell and we can’t test it. (Once per week Cam can auto stabilize near death.)</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Calida asks Carina to bless her weapon and the wood grain changes again. Now it’s a freezing burst.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">We all pick our blessings.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Summary: Stain- weapons deal non-lethal or lethal damage at will, armor light or no armor gain a bonus to AC and ref saves, body- reroll knowledge check 1/day & gain a new knowledge skill as a class skill</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Carina- body- increase diplomacy/bluff/intimidate, weapon- 1d6 frost damage, armor- Grants water walking 1/day</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Tadita- body - auto stabilize when near death 1/day, weapon- Keen, Armor-deathless</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Desma- weapons gain shock damage, armor- force shield 1/day, body- reroll will save</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">So now onto fortifying the base as best we can. Cas gives the rest of the group potions and makes some more for himself. Cam starts sealing entrances. Dorian goes to man the periscope to keep watch. Desma remembers Promethius’s domains so she stops Caminus from sealing the door. We figure he’s gonna wait a bit then strike when we aren’t expecting him.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Woozy-Stain says “new guy! Do push-ups ‘til you puke! Serena! Make him do it.” Then Stain crawls through the window to go to bed. Serena tells new guy to do push ups until he can’t do anymore push ups. She catches him trying to make himself puke to avoid push ups so she makes him do 100 push ups regardless of whether he pukes or not. Hyde threatens him with her pistol to make him go faster. Her gun is full of live ammo because we are under threat of attack. Barbas now thinks we’re all insane. Calida does make an attempt to make her use rubber bullets but  no dice. Serena brings up that she can blunt her arrows now.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Serena goes to Carina to talk to Athena about Ares’ ax and what she knows about it. Trying to figure out when Stain might be ready for it. Serena talks to Desma about it too.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">That night, the new guy, Barbas, snores obnoxiously. [Someone, who?] wakes him up and makes him go to the armory, to get some sort of silencing spell or potion from Jynx. In a sleepy stupor, she casts a lacrima-enriched Silence spell on him, which works for the snoring… but the next morning he’s unable to speak and defend himself from Stain, who spends the morning training/torturing him in the courtyard, much to the amusement of everyone else.</p>
			
			<h3>Catastro-bee</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Meanwhile, Jynx, Hyde, Cassius, and Dorian are all having breakfast in the common room. Jynx takes an interest in what Dorian’s eating: honey on toast. She tries some honey and finds it very enjoyable, pressing him for questions on how to get more. After some confusion about whether or not an apiary includes monkeys, they decide to set out in search of more honey. Jynx decides to head out, telling Cassius he’s coming with her, and asking Dorian on the way to lead her to the monkeys that make the honey. Heading instead to the town, they stop at a general store, where the shopkeeper informs them he has three jars of honey to buy. This isn’t enough for Jynx. Dorian asks the shopkeeper where he gets his honey, and he tells them about a farm about fifteen minutes east of the base (in fact the same farm Caminus is building on, though none of the involved parties know this). </p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">They head there and meet the elder halfling woman who runs the apiary. She suits up and leads them out to where the beehives are, and starts to collect some honey, which distracts Dorian and Cassius just long enough for Jynx to cast a lacrium-enriched Enlarge spell on one of the beehives. They’re only alerted to this fact when they hear humming of Size Huge bees. Thinking quickly, they pray to Stain.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Meanwhile, Olivia is ‘training’ Barbas, when his face turns to an expression of shock and he points over her shoulder. She says, “Oh no, I’m not falling for that…” But Serena sees what he’s pointing at: a large structure, almost the size of a tower, on the horizon. The party suits up and heads off towards it. As they approach, they see it’s wider and more cube-like than a tower. As they’re going through the woods, they run into the halfling woman, who, upon seeing Caminus, accuses him of having something to do with this, and “that little green-haired girl”. The party walks the rest of the way to the farm to find Cassius and Dorian waiting for them impatiently.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Desma sends our group in after Jynx while her and Stain guard outside. After falling a lot, and knocking into Cas (sending him falling too), Honerva ends up riding a bee. Cas manages to catch the ledge of the bottom tray and is able to climb back up. He takes advantage of Calida’s rope (she set it to help Caminus).  While learning to drive the bee, Honerva accidentally signals some to leave but does not know what she just did. Caminus is struggling so he heads back toward the entrance. A little further up, Calida is now drifting right toward a Queen who is egging. She is able to alter her trajectory and hits a drone instead. The drone is pissed. Calida tries to back away. It is still upset and follows her. Other drones start following Calida too. Honerva finally goofs on bee driving and she is rubbed into a cell. Another bee grabs her and takes her further into the cell. She tries to wiggle away but is not successful. Honerva is smushed into a pasty substance and the bee begins to back away. She tries to get back out but  the bee notices and is convinced she’s a very wiggly grub. Dorian sees disturbed honey that looks like someone scooped some out with their hands (Jynx signs) and notices better looking honey further up. So he prompts Serena about what to do next. She decides that her, Cas, and Dorian are gonna go ahead, following the honey trail, and leaving Honerva and Calida to the tender mercy of our bee overlords. Cas signs to Calida for her and Honerva to head back down. Cas also awkward signs to Honerva to get out and (a miracle!) she does understand the message.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">So they make their daring escape. Calida floats over to Honerva but is captured by one of her bees. So Honerva dumps a lot of water on it to let her go. Once they reach each other, they jump down and Honerva uses her Wings of Fire to get them down. They clunk and spin a bit before activating them but they make it lower. Unfortunately, Honerva’s wings clip some bees and now both of them are foreign ouches. But the strategy seems to be working and they make it out. The outside bees seem to be chasing something but they can’t tell what it is (but probably Stain).</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">The three moving on find more Jynx signs but not her. She is eating an enormous amount of honey and Serena is concerned that they’re gonna have to roll Jynx out of here when they finally find her. Cas gets stuff in his eye and more stuff hits his head after they start calling for Jynx. He looks around for the source but another one doesn’t come right  away so he can’t tell where she’s throwing it from. Invisible Jynx pours more honey on Cas (after he falls into a cell). Serena talks her around and Jynx appears behind her. “What do you mean people can get hurt?” Serena explains why big bees are bad for people and bees and Jynx agrees to fix it. She suggests they go up instead of going back down.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">So up they go. Serena falls but is able to catch herself. Jynx asks if she’d like some help and Serena agrees before realizing “Wait, what kind of help?!” Jynx shrinks her and puts Serena in her pocket. The pocket is sticky. They all make it to the top but the exits are sealed. There is a single hole 20 feet up for them to escape from. Jynx keeps floating up toward the hole. Serena yells to Jynx for them to lower a rope. So Jynx rebiggens pocket!Serena so Serena can lower a rope down for the others. They tie the top end of the rope to a passibly stable looking glob of boulder sized wax but Serena keeps a grip of the rope too. Both Dorian and Cas make it up the rope.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 20px">Back with Honerva and Calida. The bees are chasing Stain carrying a brightly colored shield on one side and Ignatio doing the same on the other. They head for some large flowers (10 feet tall, 3 feet wide flowers) to lead some bees there but no bees follow. The bees are confused. So C and H wait for someone to run by and explain. They are trying to protect the remaining flowers so the bees don’t go looking. They find Desma to go help. New guy is painting shields to be flowers. Calida takes one and runs. Some bees follow. Honerva tries to help too and gets bulldozed. Calida boops the bee that’s now on Honerva and runs away. The bee gets off Honerva to follow Calida. Honerva does better after she gets up but Calida gets bulldozed. Honerva tries to return the favor and it is not happy to be booped twice. It starts snapping its mandibles at Honerva. She barely dodges (it scrapped her shield). Partially freed, Calida sprays her perfume right into its face. It doesn’t like that either and it gets more aggressive. Honerva tries to lead as many as she can away but about half stay with the pinned extra smelly flower. Calida starts waving her rifle at the bee and it attacks her.</p>
