			<h4>Welcome to the fantastical (and often times silly) world of _____. I am Johnny your Game Master or GM. I have been running Pathfinder games in this world for about 5 years now with my fianc√©e Alison who GMs on occasion. With 5 years of adventures in this world we have gotten a lot of stories to tell. We wanted a way for everyone in our games to be able to read the stories and delve into the lore so here it is! Our website!</h4>
			<h5>We have all kinds of content for you from our adventures to guides to help you create your own character for our games. Feel free to click around and see what you can find.</h5>
